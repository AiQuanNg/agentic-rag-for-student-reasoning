2,S0002,1,"I used r/technology and browsed the flair by artificial intelligence until I found a couple of discussions from redditors that gave me the information that I was searching for. Generative Ai is a type of artificial intelligence technology that uses algorithms to learn and produce various types of content, including text, imagery, audio and synthetic data. It is a program that uses algorithms to collect data and it analyzes this data and tries its best to reproduce something of similar content. Generative AI seems like magic but in reality, it is more so just a probability machine making a calculative guess at what it assumes is the “correct” answer based on the data that it collected. Generative AI isn’t that hard to understand when you think of it as sort of a very smart human with hyperthymesia and the ability to create based on the past things that it has experienced. Generative AI like Chat GPT is made up of a lot of learning from the internet, this explains why chat gpt can be created in the matter of seconds. Chat GPT also is made up of an automatic loop that helps it get better at context understanding, human language patterns, and conversations based on past experiences with the interface. "
3,S0003,1,Generative AI is a subset of AI that enables users to quickly generate new content based on a variety of inputs. Generative AI uses neural networks to identify the patterns and structures within existing data to generate new and original content to work. It includes changing the settings or levels of the connections between neurons to reduce the discrepancy between intended and projected results. This enables the network to learn from errors and produce predictions that are more accurate when compared to the information provided.
4,S0004,1,"Whereas most robots and AI are used for performing automotive tasks, generative AI is used to generate numerous objects and outputs. As told by a member in the community, it is mainly used to generate images, videos, and text. The member also mentioned that generative AI has an exponential amount of information that has allowed it to form patterns to help it create the most human-like outputs. Because of these extremely realistic results, AI can help to create more realistic and effective innovations. Along with being fed information via specific files from the developers, many generative AI’s are first tasked with searching the internet and gaining as much data about the world as possible. It is important to remember that artificial intelligence does not understand what an image or a person is, and thus needs to be trained and programmed to detect such pieces of data. This is where neural networks come in and help the program to create pathways that lead to its millions of data points about the internet and reality. All of this training leads to an AI that generates images and text that is as realistic as a human. The Explorer in the server that responded to me explained that the key difference between generative AI and automotive AI is that generative AI’s such as ChatGPT are more focused on creating rather than implementing.

5,S0005,1,"Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is a cutting-edge technological tool that generates information via a variety of processes, effectively modifying its output based on the inputs that are provided. A model known as the Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) is an illustration of this phenomenon. In order to make accurate forecasts regarding available textual components, this model makes use of complex patterns and has been subjected to intensive training using an enormous amount of data. However, due to the varied and occasionally contradictory nature of the training material, the outcomes of the system, although impressive, may occasionally deviate from the intended target. Artificial intelligence (AI) that is generative relies heavily on the application of complex algorithms in order to identify and make sense of patterns hidden within large data sets. This phenomenon is illustrated through the utilization of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), in which a generator and detector work together to produce original data. This technology is facilitating operations in various industries as it has a design that improves efficiency and is simple to use as it simulates human conversations. Industries can use it to store data from customers, which can then be used in the future to improve satisfaction levels among those customers."
6,S0006,1,"When I searched the question “What is generative AI and how does it work?” on Reddit, I found a post I assume to be from another student in class. Nonetheless, its exactly what I needed. Generative AI is a form of artificial intelligence that utilizes generative models to produce a wide range of content. The content produced by these generative models consist of text, images, music, audio, and videos. Generative models are machine learning models that are trained to collect data and patterns of existing content relevant to the content one wishes to produce. Using the collected data/patterns, the machine will populate new content containing similar characteristics. I see it as if you asked a kid to draw a picture of a car. In this scenario, the kid would represent the generative model, and the cars they have seen before would represent the data collection aspect of generative ai. Rather than drawing a car from a specific manufacture, they would likely draw wheels and a body structure. They would draw the picture using their perception of what a car should look like based on the cars they have seen in the past. With that being said, there are different types of generative models that come with their own advantages/disadvantages. The type of generative models consists of variational autoencoders (VAEs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), autoregressive models, and transformers."
7,S0007,1,"After research through my OKC, reddit, I learned many things about generative AI, what it is, how it is used, and how it works. Overall, generative AI, or generative artificial intelligence, is a technology that uses accessible “pre-existing datasets” to create media such as text and images. These generative AIs, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other platforms, simulate neural networks to create realistic and accurate content for users. The main difference between generative AI and simple artificial intelligence is that simple AI is used to perform basic tasks that usually require human action/intervention, while generative AI focuses on the creation of media tailored to humans in a similar way that simple AI does. The term “simple AI” is being used in this context of the basic understanding we have on the broad focus of the field of computer science based on creating systems that usually tend to require human intelligence for proper use. During the creation and testing of generative AI, human developers process these data sets through these platforms to ultimately teach human-like patterns and relationship patterns, which can create these neural networks that can generate realistic content. In a way, we are teaching the generative AI to view information in a human way, so that the content that is generated in a more receptive way to humans. It is programmed to create content that it believes we
would accept as true the most based on data and information that it draws from. This process of making relevant and receptive information by generative AI involves taking previously input information and patterns to create relevant and situationally accurate media. Overall, generative AI creates media for human use, based on data and is contextually relevant due to constant machine learning. 
The main post that I gained the information to answer this question from was the subreddit r/generativeAI by user Narrow_Lengthiness99,a screenshot of the full post being provided below. "

It involves devices or algorithms that can produce previously unimaginable things like text, images, audio, and even video. Content produced by generative AI systems can be mistake-free for content produced by humans. Deep learning, in particular its subset known as generative models, is one of the fundamental technologies of generative AI. These models can recognize patterns and structures in the data since they are trained on massive datasets. Examples of these models are Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

From my research I found a couple article posted on the r/artificial subreddit that allowed me to learn a lot more about how Generative AI works and what it is, these articles were a great resource for me, here are some of my findings:  

Generative AI is also called an LLM, which stands for language-learning-model - these are models that are trained with data. They are sometimes described as a very good “autocomplete” - which is a technology we are more than likely familiar with on our phones where the keyboard tends to predict what our next word is going to be. These LLMs are designed to take input, tokenize keywords that are within your input, and then expand it in a way that would be similar or organic like a human would articulate it. 

ChatGPT is also a generative AI chatbot that popularized the concept but it is not the first. ELIZA which was a chatbot created in 1961 by a scientist named Joseph Weizenbaum was the first of its kind. So while it may seem like ChatGPT is a pioneer of generative AI, it is the result of decades of work. Technological improvements are also a huge part of the reason why generative AI is booming, since AI models and algorithms typically require strong processing capabilities, they were not as common until recently, where even our phones are as powerful as some of the best computers that money could buy just ten years ago.

many things not just the topics mentioned above. However,
the fact that it mimics humans bring up ethical questions
regarding intellectual property, privacy, and potential misuse
of the technology. Although ethical discussions do arise,
generative AI is seen as revolutionary to many industries as it
can improve productivity due its effiecient processing power.
Many believe it can wipe jobs off the market because of its

data sets can be anything from “images, music, and text”.
Once trained sufficiently, generative AI may begin to create new, original content that is
technically based on whatever data it has ingested and processed. For example, if we
train it on images of dogs, it will begin to recognize other images of dogs that it has not
seen before as well as generate new images of ones never before made. Its application
of text-based data typically involves assistance with writing in order to eliminate
grammatical errors and utilize different tones that the original author may not have the
creative talent for. As for music, generative AI can expertly recognize melodic patterns
and apply what it knows to come up with new ones.
In general, generative AI is an application of computer science and our existing human-

able to distinguish between regular AI and generative AI. Thanks to Kumara Rangith, he was
able to explain the difference between the two, and he was able to provide what generative AI is
and how it works. Generative AI’s primary objective is to produce new data by learning the
underlying patterns and structures in the data that it is fed. There are techniques to help the AI
learn. One technique is deep learning. This is usually done by having two neural networks that
compete against each other. One is the generator, which creates data samples, and the other is the
discriminator, which evaluates the data generated. When this process is done over and over
again, the generator learns and gets better at producing data that the discriminator starts to find
difficulty in distinguishing it from real data. Another technique is text generation, where models
learn to predict the next work in a phrase based on the previous word. The AI leverages neural
networks and training data in order to produce new data that represents the data that was inputted
into the AI. It can create stories off of one starting sentence. It can create ideas from questions. It
can create art from just a description of words. It can solve math problems or create code. There

basically a AI that uses information from the internet, and tries to best answer the question just
from the internet alone. Thanks to the internet it is able to use many different resources coming
from articles, textbooks, scholarly articles, professionals, etc. An example would be ChatGPT,
which if I try asking it a question like “How does the first law of physics work?” it will generate a
response, based on what it finds that can answer the question. The difference between this and
just doing a simple Google search is that Google offers websites and have similar answers, but
from different sources, while AI like ChatGPT will just summarize everything it can find online
that can answer the question. It also generates a pattern, you see when generating a response not
only will it look at multiple resources in a matter of seconds, it will try and detect patterns. That
way it reduces the amount of false information, by just following the pattern. That's why when
using a generative AI, you don’t see it use information from unreliable resources like fake

people using the software. This truly is the most innovative part of generative AI, because it is
constantly evolving and learning at a much faster pace than a human could. Even though
generative AI is so technologically advanced, it still requires some human interaction to reach its
peak capabilities. In order for generative AI to be created, people have to write code that will
properly allow the program to run. Furthermore, there are many maintenance issues that
technicians have to sort through to achieve the program running at optimal levels."
34,S0034,1,"Q1: A user by Creepy_Warning_8502 answered the question in a broad sense. They said that
generative AI. They explained that generative AI uses external resources to find an answer for a
provided question. These external resources are searched throughout the internet and it examines
articles, images, and websites to create its own answer for the user. It does this by studying the
patterns on the internet in a matter of seconds. Also by doing this, it's able to grow in a sense of
being more efficient in the searching process. This is where the learning process comes in. For

each search, it's able to be more effective in pattern recognition and find more detailed answers
that users may be interested in. Doing this allows for maximum potential because it lets the
program examine thousands of pieces of information and provide a singular answer. Thus allows
for other programs to do the same and to begin to learn from one another. These programs can
range from finding better music that would suit your taste to creating images or detailed essays
for users to find inspiration from and create their own product. Allowing AI to really learn
instantaneously from any pattern on the internet."
35,S0035,1,"Generative AI is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating new content, including images,
music, text, etc. This differs from traditional AI models that recognize and predict patterns based on
existing data; generative AI models are trained to generate new data similar to the patterns and
characteristics of training data. This type of AI technology has made significant progress in recent years
and has applications in a variety of fields, including art, design, entertainment, and scientific research.
Generative AI primarily uses techniques such as generative adversarial networks and variational
autoencoders to learn from large amounts of training data. It identifies patterns, correlations, and
statistical features from the training data and generates new data based on these patterns. Human
judgment is required for evaluation and improvement, using visual inspection, user feedback, and
domain-specific metrics. And in other responses Generative AI refers to a class of machine learning
models that generate new data similar to existing data. This is in contrast to discriminative AI, which is
used for tasks like classification and regression, where the goal is to generate new data. In the digital
workplace, generative AI can be used to automate tasks and improve efficiency and has many
applications, including the generation of natural language text, images, videos, and simulations.
Generative AI is particularly suited to generating large amounts of data, which is useful in industries such
as e-commerce. It also has applications in the field of natural language processing, helping to generate
text for chatbots and virtual assistants."
36,S0036,1,"Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can respond to prompts and questions by
generating new and relevant, original responses.
It works by being trained with large amounts of pre-existing data such as articles, images,
websites, news, and other resources found on the internet. During its training its goal is to predict
the next word in a sentence. It is trained using what is called transformer architecture along with
algorithms, neural networks, and mathematical models to recognize patterns from words in the
data. By learning to recognize pattern it is able to provide coherent and relevant responses based
on highly accurate predictions. Generative AI uses the information it has learned to quickly and
succinctly generate original responses that are coherent and relevant; it also can continue
learning from the data and its own responses to become even more effective. Its responses can
change and adjust even when asked the same question by other people as it is continually
learning. After it’s training it is fine-tuned with more specific data and human conversations;
researchers give it responses rating and feedback so that it can continually improve. This method
of fine-tuning that researchers use is called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback."

can learn patterns and generate new images, texts, or sounds. This type of AI technology seems
to have been doing well in applications of different fields such as art, design, scientific research,
and entertainment. There are two different types of generative models in AI as well. There are
Generative Adversarial Models (GANSs). This type of AI consists of two neural networks, a
generator and a discriminator. The generator creates new data and the discriminator evaluates it.
The second type of model is known as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). This model
compresses data, simplifies it, and then recreates it. The last model in Generative AI is known as
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). This is used for sequential data like texts. With its wide
range of applications, many individuals use AI to generate images, virtual environments for
games or simulations, compose music, and even synthesize speech. AI is still in its infancy,

40,S0040,1,"○ Generative AI, stands distinctively different from many other AI systems,
particularly in the way it uses data. The core of its operation relies on pre-existing
data, which makes it less reliant and accurate compared to real-time internet
data collection, as some might assume. At the building stages of building an AI
model, the involvement of researchers and data scientists is crucial. They play
essential role in not only sourcing the correct datasets but also select and
process them precisely. This careful selection and refinement process helps
eliminate irrelevant or inaccurate data points that could potentially mess up the
AI&#39;s understanding. The primary objective of this intensive selection process is to
help the AI understand, recognize, and decipher intricate patterns and
relationships within the data. By doing so, the AI can start drawing logical
connections and make meaningful extrapolations when faced with new data or
queries. For instance, consider platforms like ChatGPT. When a user inputs a
prompt or question, the AI doesn&#39;t rush to collect fresh data from the internet or
databases. Instead, it dives into its pre-trained understanding, tapping into the
patterns and relationships it has already learned based on the developers
selection. Using its deep knowledge, it can create an answers that make sense
and fit well with what the user requests."
41,S0041,1,"Generative AI is a subset to AI, where AI is meant to recognize patterns, then make predictions

making predictions. Generative AI uses Generative Adversarial Network (GANS) which have
two neural networks called a generator and a discriminator. Generator Network basically
generates new data samples, while the Discriminator Network starts to distinguish between the
generated samples and the real data from a training set. The two networks work together in a
competitive process that helps improve the AI ability to generate realistic. Generative AI also
uses Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) which is a neural network architecture that can both
encode and decode data. The encoding compresses the input data into a latent space
representation. The decoding then reconstructs the original data from the latent space that the
encoding did. When sampling from the latent space, VAEs can generate new data that resembles
the training data. From AI to Generative AI, there is still improvement that can be done everyday
from feedback and iteration to make the models better over time."
42,S0042,1,"Generative AI is an apparatus that can pull from different sources, often in datasets, and
produce data and content based on what you prompt the AI for. One of the most prominent uses
for AI right now is ChatGDP where it essentially breaks down data that was given and
transforms it into a more human like structure or a conversation for us, the users, to understand
the data easier by how it was trained. Another prominent, albeit infamous, feature of AI right
now is AI art, where the AI takes a dataset of artworks from artists or pictures from the internet
and transforms it into art. Although it is generally not being accepted right now due to the
controversy that the jobs of artists all over the world and particularly in the U.S. might be
replaced by AI art.
How generative AI works are by steps, generally by 4 steps with the additional 2-3 for
correcting. The first step is data collection as the AI is given access to a multitude of datasets
depending on the content it will be used for. The second step is training the AI on the datasets
and learning patterns, structures, and overall the order of how each dataset works within the
datasets. The third step is testing or sampling the AI, after training, to test how well the AI will
respond to the user or feedback based from the user and adjusting the AI to make it even better
or accurate on the subject that it was given. Lastly, the fourth step is to generate the content on a
larger output by releasing it to the public and fine tuning it from there as the AI has been
thorough on its training and pre-fine tuning. The other steps are usually just fine tuning the AI
based on the data that will be collected by releasing to the public and it loops back around to the
4 steps to reorganize the structure of the AI."

including creating original content, automating content generation in fields like
journalism, improving content quality, and enabling novel uses and applications.
However, human input is still essential in the generative AI process, from providing
prompts to evaluating and editing the generated content.
The article provided by the Reddit user also mentions Generative Adversarial Networks

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It highlights the importance of transformer
models in Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications and discusses OpenAI's
GPT-3, which can generate poems, emails, and jokes that appear human-authored.
The development of generative models has been led by tech giants like Google and
Facebook and has also benefited from contributions from online communities and

open-source platforms. However, the high computational requirements and data volumes
needed to train these models have limited their use to large tech corporations.
One key development is the ability to fine-tune pre-trained generative models for specific
content domains, resulting in domain-specific variants like BioBERT and Legal-BERT.
This fine-tuning process significantly improves the accuracy and relevance of the AI's
outputs for specialized domains. In summary, generative AI has vast potential but still
relies on human input and fine-tuning to achieve success.

44,S0044,1,"Response: Generative AI is software which uses artificial intelligence to process data, inputs, and
requests to produce a unique and new answer. Artificial intelligence is key; prior to artificial

intelligence, software developers could code artificial responses based upon criteria, but these
responses were limited to the criteria and answers inputted by the developer. AI can process any
information and “think” to provide responses generated purely by the software itself, not a
developer. As mentioned in the OKC, the framework for this all to occur are Generative
Adversarial Networks. These are classified is neural networks – networks capable of original
thought – and the two types are the generator and discriminator. The generator actually creates
fake data for the discriminator which then will try to separate the fake data from the real data.
Since these neural networks are capable of learning, this trains and adjusts the AI to be able to
create its own data that mimics real, human-generated data extremely accurately. This is why
generative AI is considered to improve over time – every human input gives the AI an
opportunity to fabricate data and improve its overall function. The result is an infinitely
knowledgeable source of information capable of providing detailed information to almost any

on platforms like tiktok and instagram, my experience generated by the AI looked very artificial. My skin
looked unnatural and even though the results can be good for some, the main issue I found to be with this
is that the ideal version the AI makes doesn’t align with how I look THAT much. Some results I looked at
online were very good, the fact that AI can create professional looking photos based off other images of
you demonstrates more innovation and how technology is expanding opportunities to make it more
accessible for everyone. Also, the impact on self esteem is a concern, these photos can be perfect and

49,S0049,1,"Question 1 Generative AI is a technology that creates text or images in a non-deterministic
manner, producing outputs based on input data. One of the most well-known architectures, like
ChatGPT, employs a model, which can be likened to a city&#39;s road network. When you start at
point A (given an input), the model navigates through a web of &quot;roads&quot; to reach point B
(generate output). At each step, it makes choices influenced by various factors, including learned
biases.
In text generation, a prompt or partial sentence initiates the process. The model generates
subsequent words by selecting the most contextually fitting options to minimize &quot;cost&quot; or error.
These biases and learned patterns shape its choices, much like familiar routes influence a driver&#39;s
decisions in a city. The generation is sequential, word by word, with the model considering prior
context for coherence. As a result, the generative AI, (i.e., GPT) marvels in a wide range of
tasks. While the analogy simplifies the concept, the underlying neural network involves intricate
mathematical processes, but the essential idea remains: it generates content based on input,
making it a valuable tool for numerous applications."

because AI is always updating and learning. The
network that is created by programmers is trained to
recognize patterns in data. Once given the data to

pull from AI can create something new using those patterns and parameters. Artificial
Intelligence pulls for various resources like websites, articles, images, text, and audio files. The
programmers customize the parameters during training and allow the AI models to “make their

For this question, I wanted to understand how generative AI works especially through
ChatGPT which is defined as a variant of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) which is
a model developed by OpenAI. Chat GPT is specifically designed to generate human-like texts
and to engage in conversation with users. In brief, generative AI predicts future tokens based on
past tokens, where words typically consist of one or more tokens. As more and more things are
being generated, the tokens develop into something called a token stream.
To describe the process in more detail, with reference to the Reddit post above, it’s
important to begin with the preprompt, the initial text that is inputted into the program. From
there, this will soon develop into a conversation. The question is then technically a token or
tokens, and ChatGPT will then generate new tokens based of the inputted tokens and represent
that answer in text form. As another question is asked, this same process gets repeated. It is also
important to state the importance of the token stream because there is technically no memory. As
the conversation gets longer, so does the token stream."

models go through training, where it learns data from the internet. After it has learned a
broad overview of the topics on the internet it is programmed to specific content. This
helps the model adapt to specific tasks that they are used for. These models generate
answers one word at a time which are based on the previous words that were
generated. This allows the AI to produce understandable relative content to any
question you may have. Generative AI leverages the knowledge that it has gained from
the internet to generate contextually relevant outputs. There is no form of bias in these
outputs because the AI does not have any feelings or connection towards the questions
they are answering. So there are two main stages to generative AI: the training which is

such as text, images, or audio, resulting in multiple acceptable results, in contrast to a limited and

unique result. So combining the two together, generative AI can be best described as machine
learning with the ability to produce fresh and innovative content within open-ended domains.
How this technology works is really dependent on its ability to produce diverse outputs within its
designated domain. A good example of this would be Github Copilot. This tool is classified as
generative AI because it uses a variety of web texts for its training, operates on a relatively
unrestricted open domain, and is able to think of many ways to approach a given problem.

57,S0057,1,"Generative AI is capable of generating it own images, videos, text and/or music. It works through a process called machine learning. This process involves a series of powerful computers using complex software to try and learn how to generate outputs from a set of data. Exactly how AI works is a closely guarded secret for the companies that own one, but the general idea is that programs are used to teach other programs to get a desired outcome out of a series of inputs. For example, if you want an AI to identify a car, you would give program examples of cars. Then, the programs write semirandom code in an attempt to get the desired output. The code that works best is used as the basis for the next set of code. This cycle is repeated millions of times or more, so the semirandom code gets increasingly less random and generates better results until it can do the job as good as a any human or better.
The inputs for the AI comes from data. This data comes from humans, and they often reference items from the internet, as well as other databases of information. This massive dataset allows programs like Chat GPT to generate realistic human responses to complex, specific questions.

inputs, and curation helps it produce better answers as it keeps getting trained over time. AI generated
pictures and music on the internet are an example of showing how scarily good the results can be (for
how accessible and early the technology is) just from being prompted by anybody. The most popular

model in this space, however, is probably ChatGPT, which blew up in popularity recently with its human-
like responses coming from chatbots. This was possible due to it being trained on human conversations.

67,S0067,1,"The posts that I found on the community gave great summaries of what AI Generative is. It tells me that
it is a computer program that is able to think and create new concepts with the data it collects. The data
is collected by a neutral network that is trained to recognize patterns, almost like an algorithm, and
generate new content. The data it collects can be from various sources such as books, pictures, music,
videos and more. This technology is used to help produce many things that humans have created over
history, with a simple click of a button. It can create things such as writing articles, create new music,
new art, find jobs for you and more. AI’s algorithm is being used in place of human innovation,
inspiration or ideas. It is creating a revolutionary experience for humanity with endless possibilities.
However, in one post I learned that although AI is a program that learns by itself, it also requires human
capability in order to work. Without humans, it wouldn’t be able to collect the data it needs in order to
innovate on. To summarize, AI and humans come together to create a brand new path for content

prompts and commands from the user to come to fruition. There are different types of
generative AI and ways to interact with it, and with each new edition the technology is
only built upon itself to be more powerful. It also collects data from every interaction to
expand what they can do for the user. One interesting forum I found on Reddit regarding
generative AI was all about a Coca Cola commercial made using this technology to
seamlessly connect AI-Manipulated animation with live action shots filmed. The
animation is where it looks like the AI was used as it reminds me of generative AI that
overlays special effects over regular images to give them more life. With this being said,
generative AI is such a powerful tool that many people in each discussion are becoming

hesitant towards. In a discussion where a redditor simply wanted to start a discussion
about redditors opinions of this topic. People are generally excited and find the tool
helpful in many ways, but the acceleration of its use and power in the past year is
alarming to some."
69,S0069,1,"Question #1: Generative AI is a category of artificial intelligence that generates new outputs
based on the data they have been trained on. This term is often linked to ChatGPT. This is a

fairly new concept that if you are someone who uses ChatGPT daily, you are in the top 4%. Kiryl
Persianov, a user in this community, stated, “Generative AI is a subset of AI that involves
creating new data or content. It uses deep learning algorithms to generate new information that is
similar to existing data.” If the AI model has been trained on biases, the model will develop them
and demonstrate those biases. Generative AI starts with collecting data and then reprocessing it.
First, collect a dataset that is a representation of the type of content you are interested in
developing and then reprocess it in an appropriate format. The reprocessed dataset is then used to
train the generative model. Most generative models use latent space representation for easier
manipulation and the generation of new samples. Once the model is trained, it can create new
content by a trial from the learned distribution. Finally, the content is then evaluated by certain
metrics and given feedback. Generative AI is currently a $67 billion market and is set to become
a $1.3 trillion market by 2032. (aifire.com)"
70,S0070,1,"Generative AI is a form of artificial intelligence that uses machine learning to create new information or forms of art. This content is created by pulling information from given data and data retrieved from other sources like the internet. The content that is created can be used to make in-depth multi-colored visuals as well as descriptive and intelligent writing that can be created in real time as if you are communicating with it. With these, AI can help organizations optimize their processes by generating design variations and simulations to find cost-effective solutions. The created content can be used in a plethora of ways such as marketing, summarizing, creating visuals, or data gathering to name a few. Each of these takes the pressure off of the human workers in office. If businesses are able to utilize this cohesion of human and AI workload they would be able to have the opportunity to upscale as well as increase their output. It is these combinations of humans and technology that we need to adapt to keep up in this quickly changing world around us. Many companies are already taking advantage of this. Places like Google, Facebook, and Amazon are already implementing AI to improve their functionality. "
71,S0071,1,"From what I learned about Chat GPT is generative AI that uses AI to make music, art, text, and
other sorts of data. Now this type of generative content has been shunned by the older
generation but praised by the younger generation but regardless of your standing on it, it is
groundbreaking for our world. Now the way it works is by first training the AI to understand what
you are asking it and how it should respond. Sampling content so the AI can learn to talk like us
or from what I learned of GPT the way it takes apart art by grabbing its model and begins
learning its patterns and color coordination to simulate what could be from the perspective of the
AI and from some this has been met with push back because there is no effort into the Art it just
generates whatever it wants and people really do not like AI doing this. Generative AI is both a
tool and a problem because it’s still in early development it still has issues like giving out wrong
information or at times harmful information as the AI learns from us and some of us are not so
kind in furthering AI development."
72,S0072,1,"a) Generative AI is technology that creates new content using artificial intelligence.
The technology creates new content from existing information and formulates into
a final product. Generative AI uses previous data that already exists and uses that
data to generate original content which can involve music or images. Users of this
technology provide a prompt for generative AI and then the AI goes to work
following the prompt. Outside of creative content this technology is also capable
of decision making. Business’ for example can give the AI data and it can
generate decisions and insight for business decision. The key idea of how it
functions is that this technology goes off of “Training Data”, which is data that
gives the AI an understanding of what it is trying to produce. After the training
data is given, whether its images, text, or statistics, that AI breaks down the data
to find patterns to generate the final product."
73,S0073,1,"Generative AI is a tool that has changed how content is created. Examples of these contents are text,
voice, images, videos, and processes. Language model-based applications get trained on data by using
unsupervised and semi-supervised learning algorithms. In unsupervised learning, it is trained on a
dataset without labeled outputs. This means it must discover patterns and structures on its own without
human intervention. For semi-supervised learning, there is something called “pseudo-labeling.” With
pseudo-labeling, it is initially trained on labeled data but later uses the label generated by the unlabeled
data and adds it to the training set.
     Some large language models enable computer programs to comprehend text and generate new
content. Generative AI seems to work based on neural networks that are trained to recognize patterns
within data and use them to generate new content. A neural network for generative AI works like
neurons in the brain. Just like neurons in the brain, it receives multiple inputs from other sources and
bases their outputs to create different outputs. During the training, the AI is given customized
parameters that help them draw their own conclusions or predictions. In the end, generative AI requires
human intervention during the beginning and at the end of its training processes. Human intervention is
needed because it requires an initial data set.
     Overall, you can train generative AI to do anything by changing the weights of the neurons using a
special algorithm. By doing so, it can learn to produce better results. The only downside is the amount
of CPU time and data."
74,S0074,1,"Generative AI has revolutionized the field of content creation within the online realm.
Examples include Open AI’s ChatGPT and Microsoft’s ChatGPT-based Bing chat. At the center
of the workings of any generative AI system is a neural network that checks incoming data for
patterns and then generates its content based on these patterns. Generative AI may seem to have
a life of its own; it is progressing toward achieving some such stature but may still have far to go.
It has to be borne in mind that during the learning phase, generative AI is still dependent on
human intelligence to interpret the data that are fed into it. Its decision to mark certain data as
relevant and others as irrelevant would be at the discretion of human intelligence operating in the
background which introduces the possibility of a biased working of such generative AI.
There has been much talk about how generative AI would completely overhaul everyday
tasks that people do. It may seem interesting to juxtapose human evolution against the evolution
of AI, compare their growths, and arrive at the obvious conclusion that - as has been the case
with previous tech innovation - generative AI evolution would outpace human evolution at
unimaginable rates. An analogy can be drawn with Moore’s law which explained the exponential
growth of ICs on microprocessors within computers during the latter part of the twentieth
century. In this respect, it is worthwhile to consider the existence of some such threshold within
the realm of generative AI as well."
75,S0075,1,"Generative AI is a revolutionary approach to the way we approach really anything
we are looking at. The basis of it is that it compiles a
vast amount of already existing data in order to aide us

scratch. The post I read cited the exciting new
developments in the field of language models. They
said that it allows computer programs to have an
understanding of human text and generate new text
relating to it. Obviously depending on what we ask and
the type of content we want it to generate will depend
on how we can manipulate it. The post cited that “at the
heart of generative AI is a neural network that is trained
to recognize patterns in data and then use these patterns
to generate new content.” So in the simplest terms it is a
pattern recognition system that has been developed
from already existing content it has learned. This
person also cites that by customizing it’s parameters during training, the generative models are
able to come to their own conclusions on the data we provide. But at the end of the day it still
requires human intervention as it is an ever growing addition to the human experience."

humans are key. It is important knowledge that despite how incredible this new technology is
Humans play such a vital role in providing the initial dataset, specifying relevant features and
model learning, and assessing the output for quality and relevance. That this new AI combines
typical AI-driven pattern recognition with human input to unlock the potential of content
generation in several applications.
Though in another reddit post I found that it hasn’t “revolutionized content creation” like
the first post says. According to this user, Open AI and Stability AI have 1 billion and 100
million and highlight the “value” that is in this technology. This incredible technology will
eventually take humans out of a job. AI possesses a real threat to professions like artists, graphic
designers, journalists, writers, and especially programmers according to this post. This user&#39;s

77,S0077,1,"Generative AI is a subset of AI. It mainly focuses on content generation. It analyzes
and trains the collected data characteristics to generate new data, such as images,
music, text, etc. According to what I learned from Quora, generative AI works. It uses
generative adversarial networks (GANs) to enhance real data and variational
autoencoders (VAEs) to train data and patterns by encoding and decoding. GAN has
two network neural networks, respectively. It is a generator and a discriminator. The
discriminator is used to distinguish the difference between generated and real data,
while the generator can generate new data samples. The competition process and
mutual learning between these two network nerves can also gradually improve the
generation of more realistic data. The ability of data VAEs have to encode and
decode by compressing the data into a latent space through encoding and using
decoding to reconstruct the original data, new data similar to the training data can be
generated. In addition to recognizing text, generative artificial intelligence models can
also recognize images, and through correlation and statistical characteristics, they
generate new data samples with similar characteristics to the training data."
78,S0078,1,"Generative AI is based on large amounts of data that can be sorted and analyzed by AI
for many different purposes. Neural networks are the foundation of Generative AI. Neural
networks are similar to human brains where neurons are interconnected in order to
create a system when the artificial intelligence system is able to learn based on the data
or information. A good example of Generative AI is the recently popular ChatGPT.
ChatGPT is a chatbot powered by a Generative AI that sifts through a large amount of
data. With the large amount of data, this chatbot is able to have an interactive
experience with a user and provide beneficial value to users majority of the time. The
way Generative AI is able to do this is because of the machine learning that it does
based on the large amounts of information given to them. Through machine learning it
creates its own data and uses that created data in many sorts of ways. One potential
issue that I’ve noticed while learning about Generative AI is the type of information being
given for the Generative AI to learn because if it incorrect or biased it can be very
harmful and not beneficial at all."
79,S0079,1,"Question 1: Generative AI is artificial intelligence that creates content that is incredibly similar
to what a human can make. This content usually involves data in forms like algorithms and
models. Generative AI can create images, music, videos, etc. Generative AI can manage to do
this by involving GANs, RNNs, LSTMs, VAEs, and transformers. GANs is a widely used
framework that involves two networks where a generator creates new data similar to the original,
and a discriminator tries to separate the real data from the generated data. This helps generate

better content that is exactly like human made content. RNN and LSTMs help generate language
in a sequential form like in predictive text. VAEs help generate images by using a network and
encoder. Transformers are trained and also help generate language, mainly in chatbots and
translations to generate text that is applicable. Generative AI also has a process that it follows
where the algorithms first observes existing content to learn it’s pattern which is known as the
training phase, creates new content by sampling the pattern which is the interference phase,
receives human feedback to improve the content created known as the feedback loop, and finally
produces a wide variety of content which is the generation phase."
80,S0080,1,"When joining the regenerativeAI thread, I was pleasantly surprised to see that users, whom I can
only assume are my classmates, had already made threads with these questions. Most of the answers
said to go into an AI program, such as ChatGPT, plug the question(s) in, and see what it gave you.
The prompt to this question is to use your own research and answers from the thread; what I’ve
gathered is that Generative AI is a form of artificial intelligence that, based on user prompts and
responses, will then provide answers and/or information gathered from information that it already
has in its system, as well as from learning from the user. The more information/data and parameters
a user gives the program, the more it can adapt and tailor responses for the prompt, ultimately giving
the user more specific feedback. This information, however, should be checked for correctness, as
not all the AI databases are up to date or accurate. On the other side of that, there are now AI
programs that give prompts, and can now come up with art, writing, business models, music, videos,
etc. At this point, the applications and uses of AI are rapidly evolving, and the programs are adapting
to prompts and user feedback quickly, allowing for more accurate results to what the user wants."
81,S0081,1,"Question 1- The term “generative AI” is used to describe AI systems that can create new

to the general public recently. The widespread implementation of AI will have far-reaching
consequences for the future of business, affecting everything from daily operations to product
development to worldwide expansion. Generative AI has impressive capabilities and a wide
range of possible implementations. Blog entries, code, poetry, FAQ responses, sentiment

This works by using generative models to create new stuff that resembles data it has been trained on previously to create the new content. These models can generate new data and also music, pictures, images, and more. This is all done by learning the underlying patterns and structures from a given set. Chat GPT is an example of generative AI that is very relevant right now. Generative AI can provide humans like SMS assistance and customer support. Conducting analyses on large datasets and summarizing it all is a big part of generative AI. Locating bugs in code is also a helpful tool from it. Generating medical images and diagnoses in healthcare are enhanced through this AI. Its many uses make it a very powerful machine learning tool.

chatbots. It wasn’t until recently with the development of things such as GANs (generative
adversarial networks) and websites such as ChatGPT that we could use generative AI to create
types of content that seem real.
This type of content is able to be generated through a process. First, the generative
AI model collects data from whatever information you provide it with. Then an initial
seed or input is required for it to be able to create some type of output. For example, if you want
to generate an image of a student completing their homework, you have to let the AI know
through the use of words/sentences. The AI will then begin generating an output or multiple
outputs based on your request. A user can then provide feedback or make small tweaks that the
AI will acknowledge in order to generate the desired output. Overall, generative AI is all about

the identification and learning of the data, inputs, and the patterns that it receives. It is then able
to use this and create different types of iterations depending on the user&#39;s requests."
85,S0085,1,"Through my OKC/SMP community that I have joined, generative AI was explained as a branch
or type of artificial intelligence. Generative AI utilizes information, data, and patterns from the internet to
be able to generate new information that is being needed. The idea of generative AI was broken down into
thinking of it as a computer that holds a great amount of data. It then takes all of this data to be able to
create a new outcome. Generative AI is able to take just an idea or concept that is being provided by the
user, which it then utilizes the data and information that it already has to be able to generate the output
that is being asked of. Generative AI is able to generate any output that the user is looking for, from short
answers to pictures to designs and more. The concept of generative AI can be utilized to improve
organizations in multiple aspects. Organizations can use generative AI to be able to reduce their costs
while simultaneously improving other aspects like employee productivity and customer satisfaction.
Although generative AI can be utilized to improve an organization, there are some concerns that come
with it, such concerns include data privacy and ethical information."
86,S0086,1,"Step 1: Generative AI models always start by learning from a large dataset of existing examples. Much
like how a human infant's brain begins its cognitive journey by absorbing and processing information
from its surroundings, Generative AI models take off on their educational path by studying the patterns,
structures, and nuances that exist within extensive datasets. To better understand this concept, we can
say Generative AI effectively mirrors the way humans acquire knowledge and expertise over time. The
quality and diversity of the training data significantly impact the model's ability to generate coherent and
meaningful content. Hence, a greater volume of data leads to improved outcomes.
Step 2: Depending on the type of data being generated and the desired output it is necessary to choose
the “neural network” that will do the best job. This process mirrors the human brain's versatility, where
we employ different neurons depending on the specific task we are doing or the knowledge we are
acquiring.
Usually these networks are deep learning models. Common model architectures used in generative are:
- Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Transformers, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
Step 3: Hands on!! Or brains on!! It is time to train the neural network. During the training process, the
model learns patterns, relationships, and structures present in the training data.

Step 4: 1,2,3, Action! The output generation process is iterative, starting with some initial input and
iteratively generating the rest of the content. After the first output, generative models may go through an
optimization process to make the result more coherent and realistic."

88,S0088,1,"Generative AI uses generative models to produce new data that resembles existing examples in a
dataset. This technology operates through two main components: a generator and a discriminator.
The generator is basically like the creative force behind generative AI, it essentially makes new
things from what it learns. It uses patterns and data from its extensive training set to create
entirely new content, such as text, images, music, or simulations. The discriminator then
evaluates this AI-generated content to determine whether it appears to be real or fake. It is almost
like a digital detective. The generator and discriminator continue to work together in a loop,
trying to get better and better. The generator tries to create content that looks real and accurate,
and the discriminator gets better at judging if it’s real or fake. As this cycle goes on, the
generative AI’s output becomes more and more convincing. The generator gets better at creating
content, and the discriminator gets better at judging it and detecting any holes or flaws. Through
this repetitive process, generative AI can generate data from scratch. Over time, generative AI
can create data that is so convincing and human-like that it can be challenging to decipher
between AI-generated and human-made content. The possibilities of generative AI can be both
exciting and terrifying at the same time."
89,S0089,1,"Before reading through the threads in this community, I had a brief understanding
of what generative AI was. I had only heard of ChatGBT before but didn’t really
understand how it worked or how the answers were developed so concisely. In the About
Community section of the group I joined is a brief explanation of what generative AI is. It
states that generative AI is composed of text, audio files and images to create new content
out of scratch. As I started looking though the group posts, I found a question that wanted
generative AI explained to somebody who had no knowledge on it. One individual
explained it as asking somebody to paint a picture of a car driving on the highway. Since
this person has the knowledge of what a car looks like, they are able to draw it on a piece
of paper. The same goes for all of the other elements that go into a car driving on the
highway. This concept explains generative AI in simple terms but instead of a person, it
is a computer “drawing” the picture. In the same way the person is able to draw a picture
from knowledge, a computer is able to create sentences from huge amounts of data that is
accessible to it. Having such a massive amount of data, generative artificial intilligence is
able to create something unique."
90,S0090,1,"Generative AI is a network that
analyzes data, patterns, programs and uses this information to develop new content. You
input data and information into the generative AI network. It then produces content based
on the data that is in the network. This process can be seen as teaching creativity to a
network full of data. We can see this in websites that allow you to input a prompt like,
Barak Obama holding a pigeon. The generative AI tool would use the data in the network
to provide the picture that best fits the prompt. It is a creativity and innovation working
together to continue to grow. Generative AI differs from OpenAI like ChatGPT because it
doesn’t just provide data, but it provides content. It is taking the data that has been
analyzed and takes a step further. The generative AI network relies on the data to produce
content, but also relies on humans to provide the data and parameters. There have been
multiple occasions where generative AI does not produce what the user wanted, and
feedback is the best way to correct the issues. Humans using AI tools have the
responsibility to provide said feedback. Generative AI continues to go through
improvements and updates based on feedback and data that is input."
91,S0091,1,"a. After extensive research across reddit I came across a recent post which linked
to an explanation of how ChatGPT(generative AI application) works. The links
screenshot of the discussion and the article are below. The article is also
hyperlinked here.
b. From my understanding via the article and posts, generative ai or chatgpt is
essentially a program that can be accessible via a web browser which utilizes AI
in order to talk to you, answer questions, or do work. From what my
understanding, ChatGPT utilizes a method called “reasonable continuation”.
Reasonable continuation essentially builds off of a ranked lists(which utilizes
probability) of words/phrases/answers to build off of the information you give it.
The method is also somewhat randomized; for example, if you were to ask
ChatGPT to fill in the blank “The best thing about AI is the ability to _”, the
generative AI would pull words based on a search and give those words a
ranking which will determine its probability of being selected as its answer. I
believe this AI applies “reasonable continuation” in order to answer any
questions. The randomness allows for a more inconsistent generation between
asking the same question multiple times. Generative AI also is the utilization of
neural nets along with machine learning. It takes advantage and essentially
learns from the data that is being imputed to give better/accurate results."
92,S0092,1,"Generative artificial intelligence refers to technology that makes it possible for machines to use
mediums like text, audio files, and images to create novel content. Also known as creative AI,
generative AI is a subset of machine learning that generates content in a way that is different
from traditional AI models. While traditional AI models are trained on large datasets–via human
intervention–to recognize patterns and make predictions based on existing data, generative AI
actively creates new data that does not already exist by using algorithms and models designed
for creating new content, ranging from text to musical compositions and visual art. One popular
framework for approaching generative AI is a generative adversarial network (GAN). A GAN
consists of two intertwined neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator
creates new data based on its training data, while the discriminator assesses the data and
determines whether or not it is legitimate. Through an iterative process, the generator ultimately
produces content that the discriminator cannot differentiate from real data. Complementing GANs
in the generative AI domain is the variational autoencoder (VAE). As opposed to generating exact
replicas and mimicking its training data precisely, as a GAN does, a VAE produces new variations
of input data. At its essence, generative AI represents the confluence of algorithmic analysis and
content creation."

way that I am able to interpret it is to think of Generative AI as a platform that can program new
things. Many of the articles posted on the main page focused on ways that AI can improve

Artwork, audio files, or business work. In ChatGPT it helps with writing, creating ideas,
grammar, etc. As for artwork, you can ask AI to create certain images using keywords to
describe it and generative AI brings that description to life and into art forms. The audio files
can be used and over time gathering enough data on these audio files AI can create their own
audio files sounding like the original and make them say anything they want. As for business
work it can be used in different ways leading from company automotive chatbot to AI that

thread mentioned how they’re using generative AI in the industry they’re working in, by using it
to speed up the process of ideas into final products and cutting down on waste and expenses
when creating physical products. Like turning the concept sketch into a 3D design, and making
corrections on the design before the physical sample is made and put into production. A lot of
posts also mentioned how even though generative AI is useful in these aspects, there’s a
concern regarding where the data is coming from such as privacy concerns, so, there needs
better regulation regarding sensitive data."
96,S0096,1,"Generative AI is a machine learning technique that uses data to create something new. This
artificial intelligence works by using generative models to take existing information and use data
patterns to produce new information. Generative AI predicts and generates a wide range of new
content that can be in the form of text, images, or other data. This concept is quite fascinating
because it can be used in so many ways.
ChatGPT is a great example of an application that uses generative AI to produce text or images
based on information or prompts the user inputs. It’s an innovative way to utilize artificial
intelligence to gain new information that can improve your understanding of a certain topic or
even help you solve a problem. For example, if you ask ChatGPT a question or give it a prompt,
it will provide you with an answer instantly.
Generative AI can also be used in creative works like art. It can learn the many artworks of a
specific artist and reimagine those pieces to generate a new image. I think generative AI is
extremely useful because it uses information to make something new that can later be used for
future innovations. Generative AI applies the data it has in a new way that creates value."
97,S0097,1,"Generative AI is an artificial intelligence that has the ability to synthesize and create
different and original forms of content and data, such as pictures, writings, etc. For example,
ChatGPT, is a generative AI that is able to make different forms of essays and writing works on
the parameters of a user. There are also the fairly infamous Ai art generators that are able to
craft astonishing pieces of artworks. What gained Generative Ai much popularity is that fact that
these said works and content are difficult to distinguish from real, “man-made” content.
Essentially, the artificial intelligence uses a multitude of data. This data can range from different
sets of texts or artworks, depending on the AI’s focus, which would then analyze and the data’s
format to create similar models. There are multiple ways Generative AI can work, such as
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which uses a generator, that creates unique original
data samples, and a discriminator, which helps train the generator to make data samples
perfectly identical to other real data. There is also Variational Autoencoders, which, similar to
GANs, essentially uses an encoder to produce data, and a decoder to help make the data
similar to real data. These techniques are trained to help make the AI to create more original
content effectively."
98,S0098,1,"These are screenshots from the subreddit, with the question and a couple answers that
were given. From what I have gathered from the subreddit generative AI is a form of
artificial intelligence that creates any sort of media including pictures, writing, or models
using the input training data. Generative is not creating new media from nothing
however, generative ai uses patterns and structures within existing data to create new
media. Generative ai also will not repeat or recreate what is in the original data that it is
learning from. It produces and entirely new piece of content. A popular example of
generative AI is ChatGPT. ChatGPT is a chatbot which can engage in human like
interactions with the user and providing detailed information on any subject. There are
infinite uses of this application ranging from casual use to acquisition of advanced
knowledge. Generative AI has the potential to change the world with the way it can
potentially be used in the future. Possible applications could be faster and higher quality
software code, conversational chatbots that can be trusted, and it can even be used to
create better and more trustworthy AI. Generative AI is always building upon itself to
become even more accurate."
99,S0099,1,"Generative AI is artificial intelligence that has the ability to create content for various
purposes, including text, code, images, speech, videos, and 3D models. AI possesses a human-
like capacity for learning, and the content it produces can often closely resemble human-
created content. You can train AI to meet your specific needs by providing it with relevant
information related to the particular field or task you want it to excel in.
The increasing human-like quality of AI-generated data can be attributed to the architectural
structure of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). In a GAN setup, there are two main
components:
The Generator, responsible for producing content.
The Discriminator, tasked with evaluating data and learning to differentiate between real and
fake data generated by the generator.
Over time, the generator continuously improves its content generation process, making it
increasingly challenging to distinguish between real and generated data. As the generator
becomes more proficient at creating data, the discriminator also enhances its ability to identify
fake data amidst the real data.
After AI has been trained it can generate new data samples that resemble the training data that
was provided to it to learn. It’s worth noting that AI can also be dangerous in the sense that it
can be used for malicious purposes."
100,S0100,1,"Information about generative AI was already posted on the subreddit. From my understanding,
generative AI is used as a tool to stay ahead by fluctuating products and services based on the
changes in human behavior during certain periods and future events. This allows businesses to
stay ahead of other companies in the same market. It does this without human supervision. The
generative AI intakes patterns and can generate everything from text to videos all without human
supervision. The generative AI is being used in fields such as the entertainment field and many
other business-related fields such as finance and real estate. Another interesting use of generative

AI would be in the healthcare field. By being shown certain medical scans such as a CT scan or
x-ray the generative AI can help assist in finding cancer, heart diseases, and many more medical
issues. Generative AI is being used by almost all fields that need pattern recognition tools and

102,S0102,1,"Generative AI, often referred to as Generative Artificial Intelligence, is a subset of artificial
intelligence that focuses on producing unique and innovative material, data, or outputs. The goal
of this area of AI is to develop models and algorithms that can generate new, frequently
human-like data or content, including photos, prose, music, and other types of media. Natural
language generation, image generation, and even the production of deep fake films are some of
the applications where generative AI has become increasingly popular.
There are several key techniques and approaches used in generative AI:
1. GANs, or generative adversarial networks: A well-known framework in
generative AI is GANs. They are made up of two competitively trained neural
networks, a discriminator and a generator. The discriminator seeks to
discriminate between genuine data and generated data, whereas the generator
aims to produce data (such as photographs) that cannot be distinguished from
real data. The generator improves its ability to create realistic material through
this adversarial training process. For example, style transfer and picture
production both make extensive use of GANs.
2. For tasks like creating natural language, generative AI uses recurrent neural
networks (RNNs) and LSTMs. Because RNNs and LSTMs can produce
sequences of data, they are suitable for applications like text production,
chatbots, and others that require sequential data.
3. VAEs, or variational autoencoders, are tools for producing structured data, such
pictures. Both a generative network and an encoder network are involved.Applications like image synthesis and data compression are common uses for
VAEs.
4. Transformers: The GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series of
transformer models has changed natural language generation. To produce text
that is coherent and appropriate to the situation, these models employ
self-attentional mechanisms and previously learned information."
103,S0103,1,"From what I understood after reading the answers on Reddit, generative AI is a type of AI technique that makes new content, it works by gathering data in patterns in order to generate new ideas. It works by gathering information (data) from various resources and forming an answer to a specific question. It is faster and more essential than using Google for answers, because instead of looking at different links you can just get straight answers from AI in its own way by uploading images. There is a feature in this AI tool which is a discriminator; it helps determine if the information is fake or not. As one user said, “So for those creative workers out there like copywriters, graphic designers and web designers, instead of worrying that you might get replaced, you can instead use this technology to your own advantage”.It can analyze pictures, videos, articles and create detailed paragraph of the topic. A type of generative AI; GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks). The GANs are used to take noise input and generate texts, images, and videos. Although the risk of using such AI is that the answers might be biased or inappropriate information, so it is always better to be able to use different resources to get more accurate answers."
104,S0104,1,"After reading various threads, I can say AI has many facets. Its uses include a variety of things such as creating new job opportunities, supporting individuals with minute tasks, freeing up time and boosting efficiency, and acting as a tool for creative review and enhancement. Some specific tasks mentioned are content creation (such as that for social media and marketing), music composition, and artistic creation and analysis (to inspire, motivate, and even aid artistic flow). The generative AI model works off memory and collected data form prior tasks/items. This means the AI technology gets better, stronger in a sense, as you feed it more information. It doesn’t allow for “improvising,” meaning what you feed it, is what it will learn, making it restricted and controlled by its user, or in other words: you. We learn with this, that like many other concepts in technology, generative AI is a model that cascades off other developed technologies, as mentioned in the comment’s linked article. With that said, many varying opinions surround generative AI, some more positive and others more negative, and personally, I see both sides playing out. Many opinions are shaping and forming as generative AI, as well as AI in general, emerges and realizes. "
105,S0105,1,"Generative AI is AI that helps create forms of art, music, text, images, etc. Artificial Intelligence
can configure these items on its own through systems that have been built, requiring little to no
human intervention. The AI is able to do so under models like GPT-3, this allows for the system
to understand patterns in order to generate the final product. Through this model, it allows for the
AI to work on its own, all you have to do is provide data samples, trainings and the rest can be
done through this technology."
106,S0106,1," Generative AI can be explained as two separate terms to start. First, AI is using machine
learning techniques to create and model certain structures or algorithms of a given set of
information. Generative, can be explained as outputting new content in a relatively
viewable manner, this includes text, images, and audio. Generative also refers to the
output being more than the input, in that there are a wide range of acceptable outputs to
the one input. To put it into perspective, there are a few apps already developed that
utilize generative AI. Generative models have been used for years to analyze numerical
data, but now the usage has been extended. To begin, we have GPT-3, also known as
chatGPT. This is considered to be generative AI because the AI is trained on web text,
and it is generative due to the output not being fully defined by the input, resulting in
multiple results. Google translate could possibly be seen as generative, but the output
could be considered to be too narrowly defined by the inputted text. IBM is also using
generative AI to create models of data that can be used to discover new molecules, create
more efficient code, and synthesize conversational chatbots built on data."
107,S0107,1,"Generative AI is a type of Artificial Intelligence that possesses the ability to generate new content based on the data it has been trained on, rather than traditional AI models that rely solely on existing data. This innovation allows generative AI to create outputs that either mirror the format of the input it receives or transform it into entirely different formats. There are three types of generative AI, including GANs, VAEs, and autoregressive models. Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs, employ a dual neural network approach, with a generator that produces new data as well as a discriminator that distinguishes between the generator’s output and the real data from a training dataset. Variational Autoencoders, or VAEs, compress data into a compact representation called the latent space, creating a sort of summary of the original data in a simpler form. Lastly, autoregressive models typified by language models like GPT, generate data incrementally, leading to coherent and contextually appropriate text generation. Generative AI has been expanding, primarily due to the exponential growth of data itself. With countless datasets at its disposal, generative AI can produce content at an extraordinary rate. Generative AI also has potential to be used in innovative ways by organizations, and the changes it can create could be revolutionary."
108,S0108,1,"I posted on the Reddit to try to get some of the communities answers for this assignment. The first question I didnt need to look that far though. In the description of the group it describes it. According to the definition provided by the group it says “Generative artificial intelligence refers to the programs that make it possible for machines to use things like text, audio files, and images to creat content.” It is basically all the new artificial intelligence applications we have seen popping up all over the internet recently. Instead of electronic technology just repeating what we make it to, artificial intelligence is creating and thinking on its own, and generative artificial intelligence is more on the creative side of artificial intelligence. It is the ability for artificial intelligence to interpret audio, visual, and text content to create its own humanlike version. It used to be thought that this kind of artificial intelligence was impossible or only possible in the distant future, but all these recent developments, especially like chat gpt and implementations it has been using, we are reaching it a whole lot quicker. WIth all these new technologies, it is aiding everyone around the world to be more productive, which means the technology will develop even quicker.

The aim for the generative AI tool is to create an end digital product that closely matches what was requested by the prompt. This is done by analyzing data which the AI tool has liked to certain keywords in the prompt. 
For example, An AI program which generates images could be asked to produce a picture of “man holding an apple”. The AI then scours the internet for all possibilities. It will search exact references, man, men, apples, maybe even fruit, to comb every bit of data which can help in its accuracy to produce an image the user would be satisfied with. This is millions, billions, easily trillions of reference points that the AI can draw on. And in the end, the software will generate a digital image it believes to be a “man holding an apple”.

This learning process involves adjusting the models parameters to minimize the difference between the generated data and the real data. Once it is trained, the generative model can generate new data samples by sampling from the learned patterns. For instance, a text generation model might take an initial text prompt and generate a coherent continuation of that text. Developers can often fine tune generative models to meet specified criteria or adhere to certain guidelines. Techniques such as conditioning the model on specific input data or applying constraints can be used to control the output.

Broadly speaking there are two types of commonly used methods to create generative AI: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). A GAN uses two different networks to create a dichotomy for competition, the two networks are a discriminator, which distinguishes between given data and generated data, and the generator, which creates the new data. It is an ""Adversarial"" system because these two networks ""compete"" to analyze and continue creating data that is closer to the given set of data.

132,S0132,1,"Generative Artificial intelligence is an emerging technology that provides lots of pros and potential cons in multiple industries. Based on the Reddit community ""What are your thoughts on Generative AI,"" it appears that generative AI is extremely controversial. It seems that generative AI is an interactive AI that takes your data, question, prompt, etc, and generates a solution, idea, image for you. According to the subreddit, an example of generative AI is ChatGPT which took the world by storm this past year and it will continue to spark an artificial intelligence revolution. One of the key points that was focused on from this source is that generative AI is iterative and that this is just the newest model of something that has been building for years now. This means that all of the past and future iterations of generative AI are built upon one another, making it a constantly developing and growing thing which means that there is no telling where it might be heading in the near future. Additionally, it appears that generative AI can make images and help with creativity, but this is also very controversial within this subreddit. All in all, it seems that generative AI such as ChatGPT is a system in which you put in data, and it generates something based on it. It is controversial but there is optimism as well."
133,S0133,1,"Generative AI is a type of technology that has been trained and uses deep-learning to generate content, whether it be text, videos, photos, etc. One of the most common terms we see surrounding generative AI is the term ""GPT"" which stands for Generative Pretrained Transformers. For instance, OpenAI is most known for its launch of ChatGPT in which users are able to give prompts and generate humanlike responses.

134,S0134,1,"Generative AI is used to create something new – data, text, images, etc. It can be used in the creative space by designing a picture or graphic or creating and writing a new email or short story. It can also be used to interact with humans as a customer service assistant or text/speech generation. The most popular example of generative AI is ChatGPT. This is an open AI platform where users can ask questions, make requests for something creative be supplied back to them, or to decipher and analyze data and computations. Generative AI can learn patterns and datasets to learn, and then produce content based on the information it has been “taught”. As a high-level example, generative AI can be given data about the English language, grammar rules, language nuances, etc. Once this data has been “learned” by AI, you can then ask it to help with writing an email or copy for a website. Generative AI can also be loaded with images, art, music and can produce its own photos or videos based on descriptive requests. It can also create documents, analyze patterns in science or medical research. Most recently in the news was the story of AI helping to diagnose a young boy with a rare medical condition. He had previously seen 17 other doctors who were unable to diagnose him. However, since AI can evaluate and compute massive amounts of data, more than any single human could in their lifetime, it was able to connect the dots and accurately give the patient a diagnosis."
135,S0135,1,"From what I have gathered in the Quora Space, Generative AI is a fascinating group of artificial intelligence that revolves around the creation of content, such as text, images, audio, or videos, aiming to mimic human creativity. This process hinges on the model's ability to learn intricate patterns from existing data and subsequently utilize that knowledge to produce fresh, distinctive outputs. The first step in generative AI involves collecting a large dataset of existing content relevant to the domain you want to generate content in. For example, if you want to generate text, you collect a diverse set of text data. Generative AI models are typically deep learning models, such as GANs, RNNs, LSTMs, VAEs, or Transformers. During training, the model learns the underlying patterns, structures, and features present in the training data. To generate new content, you provide an initial input or seed to the trained model. The generative AI model takes the input seed and generates new content based on the patterns it has learned during training. These models can be fine-tuned and improved through a constant process. Generative AI has found applications in a wide range of fields, including content creation, art, recommendation systems, and more. "
136,S0136,1,"1-	Generative AI is artificial intelligence that generates new ideas and content. It is so impressive that it is indistinguishable to tell what is human made and artificially made. It creates art and different innovative talents. Generative AI's models requires a long range of data of the specific content. They are patterns, numbers, statistics, and more. Generative AI is a subset of artificial intelligence that works by using machine learning techniques, specifically generative models, to create new data instances that resemble existing examples in a given dataset. Generative AI creates data, while the discriminator evaluates whether the generated data is real or fake. This tool helps and creates designs and different variations to make tasks more efficient and effective. It operates by predicting and generating text, images, or other data based on learned patterns. Generative AI is meaning artificial intelligence which is capable of generating text, images, or other media by using generative models. It's like for example using Chat GPT to look up information that you need to understand. Many companies use this to figure out solutions to problems they have much faster than a human could. Generative AI is a computer with a huge amount of data. It is able to use this data it is to create new answers from scratch."

138,S0138,1,"Generative AI is created by a “neural network that is trained to recognize patterns in data and
then use these patterns to generate new content.” Someone innovatively explained generative AI
as a human brain that absorbs the information around it and can synthesize it to create new ideas
and solutions. Generative AI is able to sort through and learn from vast amounts of data to create
something new from that existing data. The applications are endless, from medical inventions
and art to automation and music. Generative AI can even create movies and films entirely on its
own. Human input is still incredibly important in the process, especially to start the process.
Large language models are some of the most innovative applications of the technology.
OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard are only two examples of large language models that are
impacting the world. However, there are also certain challenges, including the large amounts of
data that are required and their respective computational resources, in addition to ethical
considerations. Job displacement is another key issue, and with many jobs being replaced by
generative AI, the job market is quickly transforming, which could lead to a rapid decline in
jobs. In the book The Coming Wave, the authors highlighted that for many people the jobs will
not come quick enough to the rate of displacement. These benefits and challenges will have to be
weighed and considered as generative AI becomes more and more developed into the future."

complex algorithms are used to accomplish this type of data. These algorithms are 
preprogrammed instructions that command computers to learn and make decisions independently

Supervised learning is an algorithm trained to recognize pattern in the data. Unsupervised 
learning is when data is unlabeled, and the algorithm is trained to find patterns f data without any 
prior knowledge of what is looking for. Reinforcement algorithm is trained to make decision

Because of all the programming going into it, they can respond to a wide range of topics and conversations. Generative AI is useful in so many ways. All you have to do is find a generative AI program, such as ChatGPT, type in your question or conversation, and the AI will begin to talk to you just like anyone else would. The AI just has a wider range of knowledge and can think without having to really think. People have used AI to create recipes, workout plans, name things, and so much more.

142,S0142,1,"An artificial intelligence called generative AI creates new data using algorithms. Generative AI can be applied new contents like text, images, graphics, music, literature, and other forms of artistic expression. A machine learning model is trained on big datasets of existing data to discover trends and styles. Deep learning, a kind of machine learning, makes use of neural networks to analyze and learn from data, making it possible to perform more difficult tasks like speech and picture recognition. You can utilize the model to create new content once it has been trained. This is accomplished by giving the model a starting seed or input.
Depending on the application, generative AI models can be directed or modified to generate content that conforms to predetermined standards or specifications. This may entail changing the specifications, picking a specific aesthetic, or creating material in certain languages. It is critical to assess the created content's quality and suitability. The importance of reliability and precision can't be overemphasized in some applications, such as the development of text for legal or medical documents. It is crucial to remember that AI still has its limitations according to the data and algorithms on which it is educated.

143,S0143,1,"Generative AI is an exciting branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that's all about creating fresh things, like text, images, or music. Instead of merely recognizing or categorizing stuff, it's about AI getting creative, just like you might in an art class. One way this works is through something called Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Imagine it as a friendly competition between two AI buddies. One buddy, known as the ""generator,"" tries to craft things that look real, while the other buddy, called the ""discriminator,"" attempts to tell the real stuff from the fake. They play this game repeatedly, with the generator getting better at making things that seem genuine. Another way is using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). These are experts at dealing with sequences, like text or music. They learn from a bunch of examples and then use that learning to produce new stuff. You give them a starting point, and they continue it in a logical way. Generative AI is super handy for making chatbots sound smart, producing impressive art, or generating lifelike images. But, remember, it needs responsible use because it can sometimes create things that are untrue or even harmful. So, while it's a fantastic tool, it's important to use it wisely."

The process on how generative AI works is through the use of inputting prompts or other inputs such as imagines and giving the AI a certain request to do. The AI then follows it and outputs the work it created. Many works can range from new pictures being created to cleaning up and helping post process pictures and well as creating deep fakes of people to use in videos. The number of things that generative AI can now do has increased over the past years due to improvements in AI as well as the increase of AI engines accessible to the public. Some of these are AI programs such as SinGan which allows imagines to be added upon and even made animated. CLIP is another one that can be used to create both images and text at the same time. Generative AI is a tool that can be used for fun in an everyday lifestyle to see cool images or create fun art but at the other end of the spectrum AI can also be used to improve businesses and be a productivity improvement.

There are easier tools to make than others. Generative AI in the form of arts can be incredibly fun and interesting whereas the use of LLM to talk to like a personal assistant can be personally enriching or helpful. I see a lot of AI that has come out that is advertised for doing homework for small children. I think in this sense that it can be damaging to the generations to come, as there is less of a need to learn these skills when you can rely on the mind of your computer or phone. I think there is a lot more merit to using it in conjunction with learning and innovating rather than being lazy and manipulative."

et cetera. Where regular AI is limited by what it’s been told, generative AI can add onto its 
knowledge! The content created by generative AI is oftentimes on-par with content humans can 
create. The way it works is through training models. Models like ChatGPT are trained using 
nearly all the content from a certain time in the Internet, while models like Midjourney can be 
selectively trained through users feeding it content. During training, models will understand 
patterns and relationships, becoming able to associate words with certain commands. ChatGPT 
associates words with words, Midjourney associates words with picture content, so on and so 
forth. Once trained, these models are able to generate and output mostly original content through 
mashing together everything they've been taught. What's fascinating is that these models can 
continue learning as they're being used! This allows for them to be more fine-tuned as time goes

probably why it has seen an emergence and has been a prominent subject in recent years.
As the definition also suggests, the learning patterns/algorithms of generative AI have
evolved through the years as we’ve seen in improvements of the AI; the work is getting to a
point that it can sometimes be passed down as human work and that has garnered issues that I

169,S0169,1,"Generative AI, a subset of Artificial Intelligence, employs unsupervised learning techniques to produce digital content such as images, videos, text, audio, and code. Unlike supervised learning that relies on labeled data, generative AI operates without predefined outputs. Instead, it autonomously identifies patterns and structures within data, aiming to generate original content based on this acquired knowledge.

The core principle behind generative AI is the utilization of sophisticated algorithms to analyze data comprehensively. These algorithms enable the model to extrapolate and create entirely new content that aligns with the patterns and information it has gathered from the training data. This can involve generating realistic images, crafting text, composing music, or even generating custom solutions in various domains.

The generative AI process involves training the model on a diverse dataset, allowing it to capture intricate data relationships. Once trained, the model generates content by making educated guesses based on the patterns it has learned. This often involves probabilistic sampling, where the model predicts the next element in the sequence based on its understanding of the data.

Generative AI is highly valuable for enhancing decision-making processes and optimizing operations across industries. It can aid businesses in staying competitive by facilitating the creation of tailored products and services. In essence, generative AI empowers machines to not only comprehend data but also creatively generate content, making it a transformative technology with applications ranging from entertainment and art to healthcare and manufacturing.

Models like myself are used to make it function. These models understand patterns, correlations, and structures within the massive volumes of data that they are trained on. For instance, the model learns the grammar, style, and context from the input data when generating text. It employs its acquired information to produce a logical and appropriately contextualized response when you urge it. It's like having a really intelligent helper that can comprehend and produce material. As part of the training process, the model is exposed to enormous datasets and its parameters are adjusted to enhance its capacity to provide realistic and varied outputs. It's similar to educating a computer to comprehend the subtleties of language and then allowing it to unleash all of its creative potential. Important to keep in mind is that generative AI lacks full cognition and awareness. Everything revolves on probability and statistical patterns. Therefore, despite the fact that it may look like I completely understand what you're saying, all I'm doing is using patterns I've already learned.

175,S0175,1,"Generative AI is an AI sub-element. It utilizes machine learning to generate new data and original content. The goal is often to somewhat imitate a human’s work. It can be text, images, audio or videos. ChatGPT specifically tries to produce a ‘reasonable continuation’ of the conversation/text so far. Essentially, ChatGPT is adding one word after the other, given your parameters, to try to fully complete the request. At random, ChatGPT will pick lower-probability words (i.e., if you have 5 words, the 6th word won’t always be the most likely/popular choice based on the internet). This allows ChatGPT to produce different results given the same prompt. In order for this to work, a large dataset for training on human language was necessary.
For any AI, there is underlying model architecture, such as neural networks or transformer models. This is essentially how the AI processes and transforms input data. When a model is initially learning from training data, they learn patterns and relationships. To generate new content, it depends heavily on the model, but for image generation, typically it combines learned features and structures from other images. Audio generation also relies on the training data to try to create similarly sounding music or speech. 
From Reddit, I learned specifically about the reasonable continuation aspect of ChatGPT. I also learned about the different models for transforming input data. Many responses in the OpenAI thread said to just ask ChatGPT about any questions regarding ChatGPT.

Generative AI does just this by taking video, pictures, text, audio, etc., reading or viewing it, then creating its own content from said data. It does this by identifying specific patterns within data that is already created, and recreating that data within a new form of content. However, it is not always perfect, as specifics do not always agree with the patterns, such as content relating to hand gestures or forms, to which Generative AI has a hard time recreating into a realistic form.

This process typically involves data collection, model training, sampling, content generating, feedback, customization, and evaluation. Each of these steps are crucial in order to have success with generative AI. 
	The generative AI process begins with collecting vast amounts of data related to the type of information that is desired. Once this data is gathered, a generative AI model is trained using the present data, and then sampling can occur. This is when very minimal amounts of new information are presented using the AI. If this is successful, then content is generated and feedback is provided based on this content. The AI model is then altered and customized as needed, and an evaluation is conducted. This ensures that the generative AI is providing the necessary information, and no further improvements need to be made.

What results is something that can both be considered an amalgamation of the data and new, unique content. Due to its nature, this particular type of AI requires a large database of information about the type of content that it is meant to generate. The more data that the AI is fed and the better the AI is programmed, the higher the quality of the generative content will be. On the user end, to use generative AI, it is often as simple as inputting prompts into an AI that has already been fed information and waiting for the result.

209,S0209,1,"Generative AI is essentially an artificial intelligence that can make text, images, videos, and other types of media basically all by itself. It just needs some help from a model that can guide it to a specific direction of whatever the main person controlling the AI wants to do. Want it to answer questions? People at chat GPT have done what many said would be impossible with current technology and made an AI that can help with questions. Want to make some animations? With generative AI, you can give it a script with information you would like in the story and have the AI write, direct, and make an entire animated short all by itself. It’s essentially an all you can do program that is bounded by the guidelines that the main host wants it to follow. With the help of the guidelines, it can also improve itself after each use with the help of patterns. The AI itself learns from previous generations of its past work and adjusts based on which previous installment of whatever has been done is favorited more by its host. Then it can go back and strengthen the liked feature while toning down non needed features."
210,S0210,1,"Generative AI is a machine learning that focuses on training models to generate updated content, like music to art, images, text, and the environment without human interaction. It is revolutionizing the way we think about creativity and innovation. It is a fascinating field that uses various techniques such as Data Collection. This involves gathering a diverse and representative data set that aligns with the desired output domain. For example, if the objective is to generate artwork, a data set of high-quality images may be collected. The next step would be to train the discriminator. In this step it classifies both real data and fake data from the generator. The third step is training the generator. This field aims to produce fresh content that closely matches the data in the training set. The fourth step is adversarial training. This is where the output is evaluated by the discriminator. It is the trick the discriminator and labeled the product as original instead of fake. The fifth step is the Iterative process, which is to refine and improve a product, process, and data through multiple interaction. The sixth step is to generate added content. Once this system produces brand new outputs from the vast amount of data, they are trained on it will make new predictions. The last step would be the evaluation and refinement. In this phase it is based on predefined criteria. The AI respond is critically assessed to determine if it reaches a desired goal. Based on the evaluation, the prompt is defined to improve the output. "
211,S0211,1,"Generative AI is a great  field that involves training algorithms to create new data that resembles existing data. It operates on the principle of neural networks and deep learning, where models like GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) pit two networks against each other—one generates data, and the other evaluates it. Through continuous refinement, these networks can generate images, text, or even music that seems almost human-made. It’s pretty cool. The community discussions provided valuable insights into the technical aspects and real-world applications of generative AI. You can get a gist and see just how much it does."
212,S0212,1,"Generative AI is an algorithmic computer program model that analyzes heaps of data to identify patterns. It uses these identified patterns to produce its own patterns of data that can further be compared and analyzed. Because it is forever learning, it only grows smarter and more accurate with time. From what information it receives, it can create new things with no human interference. It can be prompted to make specific things, and it uses keywords and data relating to the keywords used in the prompt to make said new things. For example, you could say “renaissance style Banksy art” and it would take the modern artist Banksy’s work and merge images together with renaissance color and brush styles to combine these into a final Frankenstein’ed digital piece of art.
To further describe generative AI, it is a machine learning based algorithm. Its purpose is to design new creative content and is largely complex to implement. The data it needs to develop new creative possibilities is not limited to a specific type of data. That being said, it can be fed specific data to achieve a specific result; it is best used in cases such as marketing, customer support, and content creation for consumption.

213,S0213,1,"It’s a form of AI that allows for images, videos, music, etc. to be created from training data based on your requests. These could be anything you ask it to make. Because it’s based on human made images, videos, etc., the generated art is going to always be familiar and predictable. There are two ways generative AI works: GANs and VAEs. GAN stands for Generative Adversarial Networks. VAE stands for Variational Autoencoders. GAN uses generators and discriminators to create new art and separates them from the training database. VAE encodes and decodes data to take your request and generate art.
Both are very similar except GAN uses AI to learn from each creation to get better at making generative art. The generative AI is not only based on data, but also a certain style. Each company has their own set of data and style for what the art will look like. The training data has patters that are used to form the art. There are also RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) that also help generate images. It’s different from the other processes in that it predicts what will come next. It takes sequences and learns from them to generate new art that’s like the dataset. Since all AI art is limited to a static data set, it can only create so much with what it learns from.

214,S0214,1,"•	According to Kaggle.com, generative AI is a sub-field of AI and depends primarily on the training data it is given. This field focuses on images, text, audio/music, video, code, 3d objects, and synthetic data. This unique content is created by recognizing patterns and structures within the existing data. The vast majority of well-liked generative AI, or GANs (generative adversarial networks) focuses on imaging creation; the foundation of graphic creation is text input. A fun fact about generative AI is that it cannot draw hands. In 1932, generative AI was formed when George Artsrouni created a device, referred to as the “mechanical brain,” and was used to translate between languages on an electronic computer recorded onto punch cards. Kaggle.com explains that GANs have two neural networks, a generator, and a discriminator, that pit against each other in order to create the new synthetic data that resembles the current data. The generator network will attempt to deceive the discriminator by creating artificial samples of data, like images, and the discriminator tries to tell the difference between real and fake samples. Some concerns with generative AI are the possibilities of any biases, fake/false information, or abuse of AI-generated material that could go against ethical standards. When used ethically, GANs have the ability to unleash new levels of creativity which present new opportunities in various industries like arts/design and music."

ChatGPT is information used to look up information that people need to understand it further. The way that generative AI works is that it determines if the content that is created is real or fake. If it is real then it distributes out and that is the information that is given to us. Generative AI also works by using machine learning techniques. Now through these machine learning techniques, it generates new data from already existing data. Some things that generative AI can do is generate text, images, or other data based on the learned patterns it has been taught. Obviously, before it is able to give out information, it has to be trained on it first. It's like humans doing a task at work. We have to be trained on what we are doing before we do anything. It’s the same thing with AI except they learn far more quicker than a human does. Generative AI can be used in almost any setting but one that it can especially help with is organizations. In organizations, it can be used to come up with new ideas or if you are trying to find new ways of promoting something then generative AI can help with that too!"

Generative Artificial Intelligence will use algorithms to analyze data and then generate new content with the information it has. The first step in the process of generative AI is data collection and processing. During this process, the AI will analyze the given data whether it is text, images, or even audio. The second step consists of model architecture selection which formats the data. The third step is Model training which allows the AI to learn the patterns, structures, and relationships within the data.

The AI model requires a large amount of datasets in the domain they are intended to generate content for. For instance, if you want to create a text model, you would need a dataset of text documents. The AI model is trained on this dataset. During training, the model learns to recognize patterns and structures within the data. It builds an internal representation of the data that it can use to generate similar content. Once the model is trained, it can be used for generative tasks. For example, a text generation model might take a seed sentence or keyword as input and generate coherent paragraphs of text that follow the patterns learned during training. Generative AI models can be used in various applications, such as natural language generation, image synthesis, and more.

The results are supposed to mimic the results of humans and are used to assist in the efficiency of procedures. Generative AI takes already-used procedures and facts to create new results and findings. The technology first collects the data and processes it to understand the procedure. It does this by learning from past or current procedures. Then, it must learn about the expected results that it is supposed to produce. It does this by receiving information and analyzing it. After this, it must go through training to learn how to complete the expected tasks. Then, it creates the results and is evaluated and improved. Chat GPT is an example of generative AI. This is because it first inputs and processes past information and functions. Then, it generates more information to produce the request of the user. Chat GPT has severely impacted how society functions. It has made processes much more efficient and has improved the way people work. For example, they can have feedback on their writing by inserting their writing and giving Chat GPT a prompt. Generative AI is continuously improving and receiving new information and feedback and is going to continue changing the way of life."

AI has an amplitude of applications that are used in several automated generation quests.
Generative AI works by training it to learn the information and data, produce new material by
learning from the previous content, receive feedback, and have humans correct the mistakes to
produce the correct information and generate data. There are several techniques used in
generative AI such as Generative Adversarial (GANs) Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks

that is indistinguishable while the discriminator is able to tell the difference. Recurrent Neural
Networks are used to generate natural human-like language. RNNs are able to produce text
generators, Autobot assistance, and speech recognition. Variational Autoencoders generate
imagery and data compression. Whereas transformers are used by using pre-existing knowledge

222,S0222,1,"With the utilization of Quora, generative AI has intriguing aspects since generative AI enhances content needs pertaining to images, texts, etc., for businesses and individuals through utilizing capabilities of obtaining fresh data that coordinates with previously provided training data through GANs. For instance, generative AI utilizes its capabilities to provide journalists with desired enhanced text inspirations by taking the journalist’s current bland text and expanding the journalist’s text for sophistication purposes. Additionally, generative AI takes undesired content needs and enhances those content needs by providing formats that individuals desire for work, school, etc., such as rendering photos for quality MP4 needs. On the other hand, generative AI functions effectively with utilizing VAEs as generative AI can utilize original data for compact purposes and summarize information that can be handy for individuals needing to fulfill compressed size requirements. For instance, if an individual’s photo is deemed too large for a submission’s satisfaction, the individual could utilize generative AI to get the unacceptable photo size into JPG, so that the submission deems the photo procedure successful. Finally, generative AI can effectively have aspects of autoregression as generative AI can utilize long/short texts provided by individuals and aid the individuals by providing sentences that helps with papers flowing coherently for specific purposes.

223,S0223,1,"Generative AI is an artificial intelligence system that is designed to collect data and information that it finds on the internet and uses these findings to create a unique response to a question or prompt that a user gives it. The findings that this AI gathers when asked a question or given a prompt are related to the question or prompt that it is given. For example, if I ask AI how to make a chocolate cake with a basic recipe, AI will go through the internet, and it will come back with a recipe it created when it has gathered information from other various sources (other recipes of a chocolate cake) it found on the internet. It would be quick with its response, and it would be extremely useful in retrieving valuable information since it goes through various sources rather than just one. AI would create its response when it has found a pattern in the sources it has gone through. The patterns AI finds makes its response a lot more reliable since it is backed up by many sources it has gone through.

224,S0224,1,"Generative AI refers to a class of artificial intelligence systems that have the capability to generate content that is typically human-like in nature, such as text, images, videos, or even music. These systems can create new, original content based on patterns and information they have learned from large datasets during their training process. They use machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning, to accomplish this. Generative AI requires vast amounts of data to learn patterns and understand the structure and style of the content they are meant to generate. Generative AI models often rely on neural networks, which are computational structures inspired by the human brain. Deep learning neural networks, particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and more recently, transformer models, are commonly used for generative tasks. During training, the model analyzes the training data to learn statistical patterns, relationships, and representations of the content. Many generative models operate in a latent space, which is a multi-dimensional representation of the patterns learned from the data. This space allows the model to generate content by manipulating or sampling from it. To generate content, the model samples from the learned patterns in the latent space. The generated content is often compared to a quality metric, and this feedback is used to improve the model's performance over time. Generative models can also be conditioned on specific inputs or contexts. Researchers and developers can control the output of generative models by manipulating various parameters, such as temperature (in the case of language models) or specific attributes (e.g., generating images of cats with different fur colors). Generative AI has raised ethical concerns, including the potential for generating fake news, deepfake videos, and biased or harmful content. Developers and researchers are working on techniques to mitigate these risks."

made from nothing. However, it does need human (user) interference in the beginning.
This is so that generative AI can start looking through the data and algorithm so that it
can make up its own content. It does not really understand or comprehend things the way
that we humans do, but rather it tries to find similarities in the pattern of words that you

conversation with you and teach you different subjects. This is all done through their
Program which takes in Text data and figures out a relationship between words to give
you your answers or task. Something that is really notable and scary when it comes to
Generative AI is how it can create images and videos that are human like but not actual

229,S0229,1,"I found a post that perfectly summarizes the main points of generative Artificial Intelligence. As stated in the post, AI is when humans try ( fail or succeed) at getting a high-tech machine to perform some task that humans traditionally involve thinking, cognition, and consciousness. Now, being conscious is not meant to be, “alive with its mind,” but being able to operate similarly to the brain of a human. There are two sections of AI the Reddit post has put AI in; weak AI and strong AI. Weak AI is a specific artificial intelligence that can only conduct a task. One example would be getting a computer to play chess. The computer will then play chess “better” than any living human. This AI cannot do anything else as its coded series of instructions is to follow precisely every time, as in the video game. Strong AI is where humans want to create a technology that is similar or even the same level of intelligence as the human brain. Some examples I came up with myself would be cyber security, which performs when things should be going well, or whether a force is trying to invade security. Many think that ChatGPT is a strong AI when in reality, it is not. ChatGPT has a long way to go to provide solutions or information that is one hundred percent accurate. It's all the same engine, but just with different starting conditions.

There are many different models used in generative AI, some of the main ones being: recurrent neural networks, variational autoencoders, and transformers. Recurrent neural networks are mainly used to generate text when typing word documents, writing emails, and searching on the internet. A recurrent neural network is able to see the pattern of speech when a person is typing and come up with the most possible text that you are about to type before it happens. Variational autoencoders are able to come up with data and create an image based on the task given. An example of a variational autoencoder that I could think of would be the generated ads when you watch a sports game on TV, as they are actually not there when you watch in person. Transformers are also similar to recurrent neural networks as they produce text based on how you type and are forming a sentence.

These advanced models are trained to identify data that follows certain data patterns, and from this, decipher, break down, and rearrange patterns in order to generate something new. These models are trained using parameters to guide the models as to their function, whether it be a language model like ChatGPT, or an AI Image Generator. Generative AI only becomes smarter the more that the models pick up and predict patterns, therefore the possibilities become theoretically endless the more that the models learn. One example of a generative AI model is GAN, which is trained to produce similar content as to what was presented in the initial training set, and then put through a test to determine the authenticity of the content.

The AI is trained on many many examples of certain patterns, and in the beginning, it completely guessed. As it starts to understand certain patterns, the parameters are readjusted so that it can better recognize different patterns.

243,S0243,1,"Generative AI is a new form of AI that generates new and original content. It is defined that traditional AI takes patterns and subsets to recognize patterns and make predictions based on existing data. So generative AI differs by generating completely new data that resembles patterns and characteristics shown in the data. In recent years, the growth of this AI has led to revolutions in art, media, and scientific research. In the post I found, there are a few different examples of how generative AI works, including different strategies. The first strategy I found is Generative Adversarial Network or GANs, and it works as the following; Generative AI uses GAN, there are two neutral networks, a generator and a discriminator, the network generates new data samples and the discriminator distinguishes between the generated data sample and the real data samples from the training set, the two networks engage in a competitive process where they learn from each other, gradually improving the ability to create more realistic data. We can see these in action a lot nowadays, where the trending usage is copying celebrity demeanor and voice to make it seem like these people in high positions are saying whatever the user puts in. We can also see these being used to make actual Ai generated music with these high-power people, which is honestly a scary sight."
244,S0244,1,"Generative AI is short for generative artificial intelligence. It has a wide range of applications including
generating text generation, image generation, music compostion, data augmentation, drug discovery,
content creation, and conversational agents. AI can be used creativley or logically it has several different
functions that you can use it for. I like to use AI on snapchat theres this chat box that you can ask questions to
and get answers from the AI. The snapchat AI works by typing in questions or things for the AI to do and it will
do it. For example I asked it to write me song lyrics and it wrote me lyrics based on what I wanted the
lyrics to talk about. Chatgpt also works the same since it will write me song lyrics if I tell it to. AI works
by already taking all the knowledge of whats out there on the web and putting things in simple terms if its
a question and music AI can generate voices to sing to a well known popular song. It also can be used
to create new content, including audio, code, images, text, simulations, and videos. Not only will it give
You answers but can create content for you which I think is cool."
245,S0245,1,"generative AI works by using information to answer questions or write texts based on prompts. There are a few key elements that allow ChatGPT to function the way it does. One function is the first prompt that is fed into ChatGPT. The example that the reddit post gives is “You are ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI. Answer as concisely as possible. Knowledge cutoff: {knowledge_cutoff} Current date: {current_date_time}.” This shows the instructions that ChatGPT is given when being tasked with answering a question or creating a text. The generative AI model, in this case ChatGPT, will use information available on the internet to answer a question or create text. In the example from the reddit post, the user asked the AI the question: Who is Bill Clinton? The generative AI generative AI is able to compose as much text as you need, but it will end at some point to allow for a conversation like experience between the generative AI and the user. The generative AI will not have a memory of previous conversations, but instead will use what the user and the generative AI itself has said in a conversation to answer further questions and seem like it is having a conversation.

246,S0246,1,"Generative Artificial Intelligence refers to an algorithm or set of instructions that produces a 
wide range of different types of media such as text, images, videos and more. After typing 
keywords into the input of the system you are presented with an output of whatever media format 
you choose. Artificial Intelligence analyzes preexisting data and uses this data to ‘generate’ 
unique outputs without the influence of humans. It does this through machine learning 
algorithms where the AI will learn new information or patterns based on previous performances. 
There are several different models that can be used for this with GPT-4 and ChatGPT being some 
of the more popular ones. For generated AI images a program must be trained using images and 
captions until it is fully trained to remove the “randomness”, anything added, from the images 
based on the caption. This randomness is known as “noise”. Once the program is trained then 
when a prompt is given the machine works at removing the “noise” until all that is left is the 
image requested. Videos work similarly although these are typically just images put together to 
create what appears to be a video. While original artificial intelligence appeared to be used to 
have the intelligence of humans generative seems to focus on the creation and repetition of 
information humans’ process. "
247,S0247,1,"•	The comments explaining what generative AI is describe that it is an artificial intelligence that produces new materials from an already published/current source such as music, images, art, and many more. Chat GTP incorporated the same descriptions as other people's comments. Others report that generative AI can also be used for solutions. It uses different strategies to redefine old content of what is being asked to produce these original pieces. These strategies are already developed with the program. From what I have read the term ""digital artist"" is used as a way to portray artificial intelligence.
As this is not a new topic, generative AI is still growing. It uses two parts known as the generator and discriminator that work simultaneously to produce these new creations, which then assess it from the existing data. This artificial intelligence uses patterns and algorithms, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), which are two distinguished techniques but are not the only ones. Degenerative AI also uses reinforcement learning to create a more realistic output for the asked prompt. Reinforcement learning uses rewards and punishments that control the way degenerative AI encounters these tasks for a more beneficial outcome. Not only is it becoming popular in a business aspect, but it is also profiting the medical field by leading to new discoveries on drugs/ treatment plans.

249,S0249,1,"From the information that I have gathered from reading about is that generative AI is another division of AI that creates new content or data that is taken from an existing source. Basically what the definition means is that it is a digital artist that can create images or scenarios from what you are asking it to do. This works by using machine learning techniques that creates new data through something called General Adversarial Networks or GANS for short. What this means is that, to get what you are asking the AI to do, you must post a picture so you can get the generation. There are many different aspects of generative AI such as art, as stated previously, but also audio, such as music or sound recordings and also text. At first, reading about what generative AI is, it scooped me a little bit because of the idea that a robot basically can generate things for you, but now I can see it being used as a innovative tool that can help you in any line of work that you are involved in. It wouldn’t surprise me in the future we see more things that are AI generated like songs or ideas for videos or movies. "

According to article wrote by Amanda Hetler, chatGPT is is an AI chatbot developed by Open AI that scans thousands of texts to learn the pattern of language and use that to generate natural language processing to engage in humanlike conversations. During the training process, it learns to predict the next word in a sentence, understand grammar, context, and reasonings. ChatGPT operates through a generative pre-trained transformer, which the name GPT came from. When individuals input text or question, chatGPT tokenizes the text, break it down into smaller units and convert it into numerical vectors that the model can process. Then, It processes the text through multiple layers of the Transformer architecture. They test the each layers and establish a contextual comprehension of the text. Then they generate a response by predicting the next token to the response based on the knowledge acquired through training. Although chatGPT can come handy, we need to recognize that it lacks genuine understanding of the context. Its response can sometimes be inaccurate or biased. "
251,S0251,1,"AI, or artificial intelligence, instructs computers to grasp data patterns, adjust to their 
surroundings, and function autonomously. This is accomplished through methods like 
machine learning, enabling data processing, prediction, and task automation. AI tools, 
including applications, chatbots, and software, fulfill roles like forecasting, analysis, 
and task automation.  
Generative AI operates through several essential steps, starting with data training 
where models learn from various data types. Neural networks, like recurrent and convolutional networks, are the backbone, enabling data processing and 
transformation. 
During training, the model absorbs statistical patterns and correlations from the data, 
allowing it to replicate relationships between inputs and outputs. Afterward, generative 
AI uses this knowledge to create new content by sampling, making predictions for the 
next elements in sequences, whether text or images. 
Fine-tuning adds control, letting AI models produce content with specific attributes or 
styles, like mimicking Shakespearean language or crafting images with specific 
features. Feedback loops continually improve the model's abilities by evaluating and 
adjusting generated content, leading to more accurate and creative results. 
Generative AI has diverse applications, including natural language generation and 
image synthesis, with notable models like GPT-3 and GANs. However, ethical 
concerns, such as fake content and deepfakes, underscore the need for responsible 
development and ethical use of these technologies in society. "

The main component of AI that differentiates it from any other type of computer system, is that an AI can obtain data based on key words or needs, and can recognize patterns, and make decisions without the need of a human. Generative AI is used for creating new content not just finding and responding to data that is already available. Some of the applications that generative AI can create include, but are not limited to, creating text, image creation, music composition, game design, and logo designing, to name a few.

They can create images, texts, art, music, etc., using patterns in an existing data set and creating something original from it. It learns these patterns through a neural learning model. Generative AI is used in a lot of settings. For example, ChatGPT is a type of generative AI that creates text from a given prompt. ChatGPT can do so through language datasets; it learns over a million words to function. There are filters on social media that can create an art image from a picture of you and a prompt. On the OKC group, many people have shared creations made by generative AI. Recently, a member posted an article regarding Star Trek and the potential to have generative AI bring the Holodeck to life (Grossman, 2023). It is amazing how generative AI has grown in a short amount of years and I wonder what else it will bring us."
255,S0255,1,"	Google is implementing a generative AI into their code. Generative AI is a “ever-evolving” form of AI. It latches onto information it can find throughout the internet, and creates many different forms of media. It can create paintings or pictures, music, or even new code. People have developed many apps that, when given a simple prompt, can generate multiple different forms of art. The biggest of these is OpenAI's DALL-E 2. If you were to write a simple phrase of any random thing you can think of, DALL-E 2 will render a picture of it in multiple different art styles, that can range from Van Goh to Cyberpunk. What Google is doing with this strategy is letting the AI find the best codes throughout the internet, so that they can implement it into their own. They are using the generative AI to create a better code than the one they are currently using. Generative AI could also help Google create a safer code, one that can detect and crack down on any viruses or hackware people may use to try and crack through security. Google’s generative AI strategy is to also create better advertising on its platform. Since Google is free for anyone to use, they make most of their money through ads. Implementing an AI to streamline their ads, will make them a more attractive destination for people to run ads on.

256,S0256,1,"o	Generative AI is part of artificial intelligence. It has the capability take large quantities of data and learn from it. In doing so, generative AI can create a new and unique product, thought, or other content based on the learning it has done. When creating the unique content, generative AI uses the learning to predict its outputs. Some of the things that generative AI can create are text, music, speech, artwork, poetry, product design, scientific research, & text summation. Generative AI is able to learn by taking large quantities of data and finding the patterns within it. These patterns give the computer an understanding and training of the components and allow it to create its own unique information. After generative AI has experience training, it can create new outputs by using sampling. Sampling takes the learned behaviors and creates new outputs that are similar, but not exact replicas of prior outputs. It’s important to note that generative AI needs to learn to be effective. When used within an organization, the longer that it is able to learn, the more effective that the outputs will be. This is because the data collection is done by collecting a large quantity of example responses."
257,S0257,1,"Generative AI is able to generate text in a matter of seconds. This includes answers to questions, language translation, writing articles and made up stories for entertainment. It is also capable of generating images, music, and video game designs. This is done by coding learning patterns and structures into the program and using those patterns to produce additional data. The internet was limited in the past when dialup was used. Back then, images and videos had to be downloaded, but now programmers have developed programs that are capable of machine learning that can produce live images and media in a matter of minutes. How it works is that programs that can take in a large amount of data siphon through these values and compare this data in order to generate an output that is as realistic as possible. Generative AIs consist of networks that are competing against each other to produce data that is increasingly realistic. This creates a feedback loop that improves its ability to differentiate between real and fake data. This continues until the program is able to generate data that is indistinguishable from real data. AI programs, like ChatGPT, are able to search online through thousands of articles to produce a realistic output for the user."
258,S0258,1,"●	Generative AI is a tool that is emerging in our society that can do a number of different tasks. Companies all around the world are starting to incorporate AI into their applications and software. Generative AI is a type of AI that creates rather than just processes data. It produces new pieces of writing, artwork, or songs. Generative AI is a tool that these companies use to create images, text, code, and more. The way generative AI works is by using premade parameters to generate texts. For example, when you google something, and there is a suggested list in a drop down menu, that’s generative AI guessing what you are searching for by using a bunch of algorithms from past searches. Generative AI can be broken up into two different categories. The first category is large language models which can be broken up into texts. A good example of this is ChatGPT which uses prompts given to it to generate responses to said prompts.These AI models are trained on millions and millions of parameters to create the best response possible. The second category is image creation software. It uses millions of images on the web and the prompt you give it to create an image that’s never been made before. Some companies that use this type of generative AI are Dall-E and Midjourney."
259,S0259,1," Generative AI is a branch of AI that uses generative models to create new data from 
 existing data rather than just processing or analyzing it. This allows it to focus on 
 creating content, such as text, images, or even music, that is generated by a machine 
 rather than a human. A lot of generative AI content has recently been becoming viral on 
 social media because its text, images, and music is basically identical to real human 
 made content. One of the key techniques used in generative AI is deep learning, 
 specifically a type of neural network called a generative model. 
 Generative AI works through a process of training and generation. During the training 
 phase, these models are exposed to large amounts of data, such as books, articles, 
 etc., exposing them to learn patterns, styles, and structures present in the data. This 
 process enables the model to understand the context and relationships between words, 
 sentences, or pixels, depending on the task. After this training, the generative AI model 
 is able to generate content by predicting what should come next in a sequence of data. 
 Generative AI is able to generate content that is coherent but also contextually relevant. 
 This is achieved through deep neural networks, which consist of multiple layers of 
 interconnected artificial neurons. These networks capture complex relationships within 
 data, allowing the model to generate content that makes sense within a given context. 
 Furthermore, generative AI can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, such as language 
 translation, text summarization, or image generation. Personally, I have used generative 
 AI to update my companies social media and advertising outlets. This fine-tuning 
 process involves training the model on a narrower dataset related to the desired task, 
 allowing it to excel in producing content specific to that domain. Generative AI has found 
 applications across various fields, from natural language processing and chatbots to 
 content creation and even healthcare diagnostics. The intensity of its capabilities also 
 raise ethical concerns, particularly regarding the generation of fake content and the 
 potential for misuse. 
 All in all, generative AI is a powerful branch of artificial intelligence that uses deep 
 learning models to generate creative and contextually relevant content like text, images,  or music. It does so by learning patterns from vast amounts of training data and then 
 predicting and generating content based on given input or prompts. Its applications are 
 diverse and continue to expand, transforming industries and how we interact with 
 technology. "

For instance, it can be trained on countless books and then craft a completely new, coherent story or generate unique pieces of art based on its learned patterns. This process is analogous to teaching a robot to paint, write, or compose music by immersing it in a library of existing masterpieces. "

Additionally, generative AI rose in popularity through platforms such as ChatGPT, DALL-E, and Google’s Bard, which pushed the boundaries of what was previously achievable in generating content using AI. 
Generative AI relies on extensive data and uses learning algorithms to create new content from scratch. This is done using “large language models”, which enables machines to understand text and generate new content. This step is called “training”, where the AI model is trained on a large database of existing information. The model is able to learn patterns, styles, and structures within the data during this stage. Generative AI consists of a network that’s trained to recognize patterns in data; this is customizable which allows the AI to reach conclusions and identify relevant data, allowing them to predict and generate information accordingly. This step is called “inference”, where the model can generate new content by predicting the next element.

With Bing Chat’s answer in mind, I am now ready to explain what generative AI is in my own words. To begin with, generative Ai is a sophisticated and advanced technology involving complex algorithms that allows it to create things from inputs that it builds upon. The reason why this is so impressive is not because it outputs somethings copied or unoriginal, but rather, it is able to build upon information given to it similar to a sentient organic being, it is able to bring forth something new and creative building upon previous information it was given, but not copying it directly. In way, it seems as if this futuristic technology is able to harvest what we human beings call “The capacity to learn” and “Creativity”. The definitions of both are widely understood but their translation to technology such as generative AI is what I believe to be widely debated. However, I understand that this technology is based upon complex algorithms and inputs to create meaningful, original, and relevant outputs.

272,S0272,1," Generative AI is a subcategory of AI that resolves around machine learning. They use machine-learning techniques such as unsupervised learning which allows AI to find patterns and solutions to a dataset with no human guidance. They then use the AI to create (or generate hence the name) videos, images, text, and audio. This typically works by showing a deep-learning model various photos that the AI uses to create new images. There are two kinds of prominent learning models which are GAN and VAE. GAN starts by presenting a data set to an AI from there the AI creates its own set of data. Then they present the AI-generated data set alongside a real-world data set to an AI discriminator to see if it can obviously tell which was AI-generated. Afterward, both the generator and the discriminator will be fine-tuned to be more accurate. This allows both the generator and the discriminator to be improved simultaneously. The eventual outcome of this is AI being able to generate a brand new image that mimics the initial data set. VAE stands for variational autoencoders. Simply put the VAE takes a large data set and it learns the patterns and features of the dataset to understand the probability distributions. Once it is able to understand it is able to generate new images."

277,S0277,1,"Generative AI is a subsection of AI that works to create new and original content contrary to traditional AI which is typically used for recognizing patterns and making predictions based on previous data. Generative AI utilizes techniques such as general adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, training data and patterns, transfer learning and pretrained models, and evaluation and improvement. 
Generative adversarial networks consist of two neutral networks, a generator, and a discriminator. A generator network generates new data samples, while the discriminator network tries to distinguish between the generated samples and real data from the training set. The two networks engage in a competitive process where they learn from each other, resulting in the generator improving its ability to generate more realistic data. Variational Autoencoders are neutral network architectures that are capable of both encoding and decoding data. The encoder compresses the input data into a latent space representation and the decoder reconstructs the original data from the latent space. 
Training data and patterns identify patterns, correlations, and statistical features present in the training data. With these patterns, generative AI models generate new data samples that possess similar characteristics to the training data. Transfer learning and pretrained models have been trained on vast datasets are often used as starting points for generating new content. By fine-tuning these models with specific data or training them further generative AI can generate content that aligns with styles or themes. Evaluation and improvement often rely on human judgement. Metric such as visual inspection, user feedback, or domain-specific measures can be used to assess the generated content.

By using quora to help learn more about this topic, I found that there are 4 different phases in the process of generative AI. The first is training, this is where models of generative AI will train themselves in existing datasets (e.g. images, text, etc.) in order to learn the structure of it. The second phase is Inference. This is when the model is able to generate new content based off of what they trained on from the datasets. The third phase is the feedback loop.

The AI generates what is requested (which it gathers from the data that the user inputted) and the product that it creates should be similar to or exactly what was initially requested. Generative AI is supposed to be neutral, and it is supposed to find patterns and structures within the data that the AI already contains to produce content specific to the request. The content is supposed to be original and freshly produced by the AI as it is not meant to be obtained from other sources. For example, if you request the AI to draw you a picture of a mermaid, the AI will not go online or use its database to sample an already existing picture. The AI will create a completely new picture of a mermaid that it itself created through the information that it knows because it does not copy and paste.

Trained on vast amounts of data with the use of unsupervised and semi-supervised learning algorithms, generative AI allows for creating new content from scratch. One of the most exciting developments in this field is large language models that enable computer programs to comprehend text and generate new content. Generative AI is a neural network that is trained to recognize patterns in data. After analyzing these patterns they use it to generate new content. By using customized parameters during training, generative AI models can make their own conclusions and identify features in data which makes them be able to predict patterns to input and generate corresponding content to the pattern. Although generative AI is capable of producing incredible results, it still requires human intervention at the beginning and end of the training process to achieve optimal outcomes.

292,S0292,1,"According to the answer I found, generative AI predicts future “tokens” based on the “tokens” it has seen in the past. A “token” is a number that is associated with a letter or word, think of the traditional binary code that can be translated with 0’s and 1’s. In order to get responses that don’t go on and on, you must give the generative AI a “preprompt” this is a rule that the generative AI will follow in regards to all of the responses it gives. Then, you can ask it a question, and it will take what you wrote, break it into its own code, and based on previous experiences it will spit out its own code to respond that then gets translated into whatever language you are interacting with it. Surprisingly, at least to me, generative AI doesn’t actually have a memory. It basically has a giant pool of information containing the tokens I mentioned earlier, and depending on the prompt it receives, it will basically play scrabble and put together an answer and then immediately forget what it just said, and on its end, the entire interaction it had goes back into that giant pool of information."
293,S0293,1,"-	Generative AI refers to computer programs or software that use already existing sources, such as articles, images, audio files and other information, to create original and new content on their own. By managing to create their own content from already existing information, each time it exercises doing this it learns from its own creation and grows “smarter”. Generative AI uses big data to learn from the internet and other sources of information to create original content. It is, described many times as, a creative artist or writer all on its own.
The Generative AI system undergoes its learning process by being programmed to recognize patterns and relationships within big data, input, and other sources it draws information from.
Generative AI systems also undergo “training”, which is a period of time the system takes to grow and learn from the data set it is learning from, to recognize the previously stated input and information. The training process the Generative AI system goes through may take up to hours, days, or even weeks at a time to fully process the information it is taking in.

294,S0294,1,"Generative AI is a cutting-edge technology that possesses the capacity to autonomously create various forms of content, such as images or text, without human creativity. It operates through intricate algorithms and neural networks by employing a technique known as Generative Adversarial Networks.

In the world of Generative Adversarial Networks, there are two pivotal components: the generator and the discriminator. The generator's primary role is to create content, like generating a new image. Initially, it generates random outputs that typically lack meaning. In contrast, the discriminator's task is to scrutinize and analyze these outputs to distinguish between real and artificial creations. There is a continual back-and-forth that happens: the generator attempts to craft content so authentic that the discriminator struggles to distinguish it from real data. This competition between real and fake, coupled with the learning process leads to the generator progressively improving its capacity to generate content close to the real thing.
For example, in image generation, a Generative Adversarial Network exposed to thousands of cat images gradually becomes proficient at generating new, realistic cat images. In conclusion, generative AI leverages neural brain like networks and algorithms to autonomously produce content. By learning from existing data and undergoing iterative rounds of competition and feedback, it contributes to the development of AI-generated content which can include things like artwork, text, and other digital creations.

Generative AI typically has a pre-existing database of information that it is constantly adding to and learning from such that it never regresses in ability, continuously making new iterations of itself based on historically learned information to produce relevant content more efficiently and effectively. There are many benefits of generative AI including increased productivity or having a new way to provide information. However, there are concerns about what the impact of generative AI will be as it has limitless potential and has already surpassed in leaps and bounds how the public assumed it could perform. Generative AI is very dependent on the user and will do its best to learn what content is most appealing to a user. Because of this, it can be subject to misinformation or biased inputs. ChatGPT is a primary example of generative AI and its uses, from being able to provide answers to prompts and questions within seconds to serving as a testing aid for coders and programmers."
308,S0308,1,"Generative AI refers  to a class of artificial intelligence models and systems that are designed to generate content. They are completely not comparable to what us humans can do. AI is really unique in so many ways. They are capable of doing so many things. It works because it’s able to recongize patterns in Data. AI is capable of producing it’s own information. Although this is now possible on it’s own, AI has always needed human inervention from the beginning and end to make it work and succeed the way it has. AI has a powerful learning algorithm, which has made it have great result. AI has made it possible with things like CHAT GPT to have access to any information you need in just seconds. It can type up a response to your question and have alot of information. Their was lots of sampling, evaluating and conditioning to make AI work the way it’s been working. Theirs many positives to AI but with anything  theirs also concerns like it giving misleading date at times. That being sad AI is a great innovation for many things in our daily lives. It opens a whole new world on our digital platforms. "
309,S0309,1,"Generative AI is a form of artificial intelligence that generates new data from existing data. It generates multiple types of data such as creating videos, pictures, and text. The response I received from one of the members explained that “it works by feeding the model a large amount of data with the expectation that the outputs will come out a certain way”.  Therefore, generative AI can use a model or neural network and translate it to code, and vice versa. One of the most common tools people are familiar with is ChatGpt. This is a form of generative AI that is able to gather information on any topic, create an essay, all within a matter of seconds. Generative AI finds patterns and structures within different datasets which allows it to create new content. The history of generative AI dates back to the 1950’s and 1960’s (Nadeem). However, in 2014, that's when it started to evolve more in the tech world. This is because of the easy accessibility of large datasets. Today, more and more organizations are beginning to use generative AI into their company and daily lives. Which is now starting to become the new normal and buzz in town.

310,S0310,1,"Generative AI is a “neural Network” that takes in information called input weather in the form of a question, image, request, or command and used the information it gathers or creates from the internet to create an output. In order to create such a machine however several steps are necessary in order to create a functional system. Which comes in the form of test and training which could cost millions each time. Generative AI unlike normal AI, is trained in order to use these inputs in order to create new and original outputs, the result of training is shown as generative AI uses and tries to reproduce the input in an original manner. Generative AI could be trained to create outputs for all sorts of applications from art, design, entertainment to scientific research. It’s capabilities allow the ai to train itself in the moment using the source and neural networks in order to create similar content while also maintaining relevance and authentic factual information. Information training allows the ai the ability to distinguish the difference between what’s likely factual and what is not by comparing information from several sources known to be accurate in conjunction to the input given to the AI."

Anything you are able to imagine this tool is able to put it together into an image or into a well written explanation. Generative AI takes into consideration all your data on your computer to make relevant suggestions to you. It uses its internal systems to create human generated content. Generative AI is essentially a category of algorithms that it has been trained for to produce any output it is given. There is a vast array of networks it uses for its learning process and within that there are numerous applications. These applications have the ability to recreate images, synthesize audio and write specific text that answers any questions you may have.  Generative AI isn’t as foreign as you may think. The well known Siri or even Alexa are considered generative AI. It was made for human convenience so we could focus on other tasks that may be more important, and easy for AI to complete for us in an efficient and timely manner. Lastly, generative AI uses VAEs, also known as variational autoencoders. VAEs were one of the models that was able to generate all the images and speeches we prompted it to do.

I was able to gather some information by perusing through the groups such as understanding what prompt means in AI. Which is essentially the input to allow for the desired output. Essentially to my understanding this is programming although i did find that ai is made of neural networks. Almost like a brain. Below is a screenshot of the questions I asked. Although brief I think the interaction was concise and to the point. 
313,S0313,1,"When it comes to what exactly Generative AI is,  I understood from Mr. Bader, the person who was so kind to respond to all my questions, his response is that basically Generative AI is obviously a concept of artificial intelligence where the sole purpose of it is to help create new content or to help create more meaningful content. He had mentioned some examples of helping create new content / meaningful content which could include music, images, text or even videos. Generative AI is basically consumed on a bunch of algorithms, data, patterns, which helps the AI develop human-like characteristics which then produces content if it were a human doing it but more automatically and technically better. What I had understood and learned from what Mr. Bader stated that basically Generative AI is a way to help improve the output that a human may do. For instance, if a human can only provide a certain type of output for a certain amount of hours, the Generative AI can do the output whenever and at whatever time which is a major advantage that a human may have. On top of having an unlimited output, it could have a more meaningful output and content which a human cannot provide. If you asked a human to go ahead and repeat the same output 100 times over, more than likely all those 100 outputs will not be the same but as for Generative AI the output would be perfect and more meaningful because it would mean all the outputs  have the same meaning then the other. That is basically what I understood from his response and I really have never thought about Generative AI in that way and how effective it really can be. "
314,S0314,1,"Generative AI is a technology that uses data and information sources to innovate and generate ideas that correlate to the topic at hand. This is used as a tool to enhance what a human can do but at a “higher” level. Over these last few years, there has been a shift to what AI is capable of doing and it is used more frequently by corporations and organizations to benefit them. AI relies on algorithms and previously collected data to function and be capable of generating what the user wants. The main reason AI has launched to the level it is at now is because the more it is used the better it can generate responses. It serves as a benefit to help improve companies and customer satisfaction because it is made to be “human” but has the capability to easily generate answers quickly and efficiently compared to a regular human. It is predicted to grow in the future because of the technological advancements it can accomplish. There are a few downsides to using AI as of right now because it is a fairly new technology and it will always have room for improvement. One of the potential downsides is generating the wrong information or user error. Since it relies on pattern data, it can tend to generate broad information depending on the type of AI.

"
315,S0315,1,"Generative AI is a kind of AI that can create new texts, photos, audio files, and videos from previously collected data. It accomplishes this by recognizing patterns in data from a number of sources such as books, images, and videos, and using those patterns to create new, original outputs that closely resemble human creativity. An overview of how generative AI works consists of Data collection, wherein the first step in training a generative AI model is to gather a sizable dataset of examples relevant to the topic in which you wish to produce content. Model training is deep learning architectures, which are often the foundation for generative AI models. The training data are utilized to train the model to recognize patterns, connections, and structures. Sampling can also use the model to produce fresh content after it has been trained. This is accomplished by giving the model a starting input. Next would be the production of the material wherein it uses the input seed as a starting point, the generative AI model creates new material based on the patterns it found during training. The feedback and iteration is also another step in how generative AI works. Its models are adjusted and enhanced using an iterative procedure. User or assessment feedback can be used to improve the model's output and make it more precise and relevant. Control and customization are also a step that's based on the application, generative AI models can be directed or altered to generate content that complies with standards or specifications. This can entail changing the settings, picking a specific look, or creating content in a specific language. Lastly, the evaluation of the output is critical to assess the relevance and quality of the generated content."

To summarize generative AI OR artificial intelligence is a data system in which unlimited amounts of data and systems are in a form of Text Generation: Articles, blog posts, creative writing etc. Image Generation: Realistic images of people, places, abstract art etc. Audio Generation: Speech, music, sound effects etc. Video Generation: Short clips, full-length movies etc. Code Generation: Python code, Java code, PHP code etc. The AI works due to data collection, model training, sampling, generating content, feedback and iteration, control customization, and output evaluation. ‘’To illustrate Training: Generative AI models are initially trained on large datasets of existing content, such as text, images, or audio. The model learns patterns, structures, and features of the data during this training phase. Inference: Once trained, the model can generate new content by sampling from the learned patterns. For instance, in text generation, it might start with a seed sentence and predict the next word based on probabilities and context. Feedback Loop: Depending on the feedback it receives, the model can be fine-tuned and improved. For example, if it generates text, it can learn from human feedback to produce more contextually appropriate or grammatically correct sentences. Generation: The generative AI can produce a wide range of outputs, including text paragraphs, images, music, or other forms of creative content (Quora, Josef).’’"

This technology can create all sorts of media whether it be text, images, music , or even now videos. It does this by mimicking human creativity. Generative AI utilizes neural networks to create content, by analyzing enormous amounts of data and searching for patterns. According to Oxford Languages, neural networks are computer systems modeled on the human brain and nervous system. Also, Generative AI uses deep learning models, more specifically Generative Adversarial Networks or GANs for short. I learned about GANs through one of my Facebook group posts, but I did not know much about it so I looked into them further. Google has a course on specifically GANS where I found that it utilizes two parts, a discriminator and a generator to be able to produce images with very high levels of realism. The generator is attempting to trick the discriminator while the discriminator is attempting to not be fooled. This is one way that generative AI is able to create new images with such amazing levels of detail and realism that are very hard to differentiate from a real photograph. There are also other models that I learned from my group from a member named John called Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). Another member named Dammon brought another mechanism to my attention that not many other people mentioned called, “attention”. This allows Generative AIs to focus on relevant parts of the input when creating new text. "

Generative AI is already being used in businesses to save money and improve customer service. One of the most controversial uses of AI was recently used in the tv show “Secret Invasion” where they had an AI create the opening credits. A lot of people have mixed emotions about it because it does take away the opportunity for an actual artist to have a job but at the same time there is no denying that it saved disney money. Another great example of generative AI being helpful for organizations are the chatbots and virtual assistants that companies are using to help customers 24/7. I recently swapped phone plans to mint mobile and they had a chatbot help me through my struggles and even in the worst case, I had the option to talk to a real person. Generative AI.

The screenshot above features one of the more interesting examples of how AI is deployed to not only save the organization a ton of time, but increase customer, or patient, service exponentially. Regarding radiation oncology; AI is used to “draw” organs that are at risk of radiation damage 15 to 90 times faster than a medical professional would. AI is also used to develop treatment plans for radiation therapy in just a few seconds, as opposed to a few hours or even a few days. This is just one of many use cases for AI within an organization. Another example of how generative AI can streamline workflow and improve employee productivity can be seen in the legal profession. Generative AI technology, such as ChatGPT, for instance, has become increasingly popular in the legal profession due to its ability to research and write legal documents more efficiently. Many tasks in this field can be automated, such as contract drafting and document review.

Generative AI’s, such as ChatGPT, have allowed for a more human-tailored response to questions, topics, and even clarifications to basic statements for better understanding. Since, as we have found, that generative AI is self learning to better tailor information to humans in a very human way, responses are able to help us innovate and understand weaknesses of ideas/subjects better with each inquiry. With this, organizations can use generative AI to observe and understand different strategies, or even use the AI to completely create a new strategy for a set goal. The generative AI uses its bank of previously existing datasets to observe, in a very human way, the strengths and weaknesses posed to an organization, and will provide the most efficient plan to maximize strengths and minimize weaknesses. Generative AI, itself, can be used to innovate since it will create the most efficient and human-centric/oriented idea to an issue posed. Although this is the case and generative AI can use what it has learned to innovate in the way it sees best, it is still technically learning. This means that it has its own weaknesses and downfalls, that may limit its effectiveness for certain
subjects or topics that it does not know about in a human-like/tailored sense.. Also, AI does not have the emotional intelligence that humans do, so emotion-based innovation will be stronger if conducted by humans rather than generative AI. Overall, with the way generative AI is advancing daily in the modern age, I can confidently say that it absolutely is a tool of innovation and can help every major industry.

Generative AI has many use cases when it comes to business, and perhaps one of the reasons why it has taken off in terms of popularity. The possibilities are endless and businesses have already started implementing generative AI/AI workflows into their processes. Generative AI is poised to replace 2.4 million jobs in the US by 2030 according to research conducted by Forrester’s. Since AI is generally cheaper and quicker than a regular human, it is definitely something that businesses want to implement into their processes. The cost savings can be tremendous for companies that have a lot of repetitive workflows - think of AI chatbots replacing customer support agents, or robot chefs that flip burgers at fast-food restaurants. Surprisingly, the research from Forrester’s shows that a whopping  78% of jobs that AI will replace will be in the legal sector, so we’re talking about lawyers replaced by AI. It’s hard to wrap our minds around, but it is definitely the path we are headed in. 

However, as I scrolled down and read some of the responses to the research, some argue that AI may not directly replace jobs, but rather complement our capabilities, much like a calculator helps us quickly solve math problems. Another user responded saying that “the result is the same either way” - and that is true and ultimately the result is the metric that matters most in business.

arguments.

 I believe generative artificial intelligence can be used by organizations for strategic
purposes. Generative Artificial Intelligence is a quicker way to get input from user&#39;s
wants and needs. The information from that can help the producers know if a product or
service needs to be reduced to meet their wants or needs. For example, online shopping.
When people do online shopping, they sometimes receive a survey after purchasing the
product to see if they are satisfied. It also includes an area where they can input if
anything goes wrong. The generative artificial intelligence then sends the responses to the

company, so they know about the user&#39;s responses. Generative Artificial Intelligence
improves customer service by being quicker in solving user&#39;s problems. This is not only a
quicker source, but it gives the customer service people more time to speak to those who
do want to speak to a person. Generative Artificial Intelligence has responses that help
solve problems quickly or it helps by providing information that may direct you
somewhere else where the solution can be found. This also helps with employee
productivity because they will be kept busy but at least they will have help from
generative artificial intelligence, so they are not overloaded with having so many people
calling at once. It can also help in other ways, such as advertising a product or working as
a survey method to get ideas of what group to target once the product is created and
released."

One way an organization may improve their customer satisfaction rating is by using AI
effectively, for example, Chatbots online. Most of the time, customers’ questions are generic
where a chatbot can respond promptly and efficiently. This will lead to a better customer
experience and have a domino effect on costs for the organization.
By using AI, like the example of the chatbot, not only does the customer’s expectations are
exceeded, but the costs are reduced by not having spent on payroll, which leads to the
possibility of reducing prices on service or products. Many organizations are strategically using
chatbots to engage with potential customers online and increase sales. AI may also assist with
an infinite amount of additional data gathering such as consumer patterns or online cart
abandonment. This will allow organizations to allocate their employees to areas that are more

Digital products such as art, music, and even articles can essentially be automated,
once again, providing exponential increases to employee productivity. The analysis of
user data and how to improve their interactions with products may also essentially be
automated, which means that generative AI can actively provide employees with the
insights needed to continuously improve."
337,S0017,2,"Question 2- Generative AI can be used in an innovative way by organizations for
strategic purposes, and it is used by a lot of companies for these exact reasons. The generative AI
can be used for strategic purposes because it has the ability to process and improve and give
ways to implement improvements almost instantly, which is way faster than the time it would
take for a person to understand, be creative, and ultimately create. The generative AI can be used
to reduce costs of both the product and cost by optimizing every process that is done. The AI can
predict what will happen in the future so it helps reduce service costs because it will be able to
determine when something is going to need maintenance or replaced. It also reduces costs by
being automated, it is quicker and less is spent by the human, being time or money spent to pay
them. Instead of spending money on things that are pointless, the ai can tell what is and isn’t
needed, therefore also removing those costs. The AI can help with customer service because it
will come up with the answer to almost every question that can be asked by a customer. This
enhances the customer experience with the company as the AI is always active 24 hours a day.

The employee productivity will be boosted because the AI can do tasks that are repetitive and
can look at all the data, something a human might miss. It handles all interpretation of data and
thus allows more time for the employees to work on something else. Generative AI can be used
for many strategic purposes and a lot of companies are taking advantage of how advanced it has
become."
338,S0018,2,"Generative AI can be used by organizations for strategic purposes, especially
those that aim to make certain business processes more efficient and effective. This
technology can come up with new content (plans, images, etc.) with the input (prompts,
images, etc.) that is given to it. With that capability alone, organizations can utilize
generative AI to provide them with plans and recommendations on how to improve their
current business processes. Another example would be data interpretation and
implementation.
Organizations can leverage generative AI to maximize data interpretation and
implementation. As more organizations become data-dependent, the bigger need for
acting on the gathered data becomes more prevalent. generative AI can assist in doing so
by analyzing the data and providing actionable insights. Better, it can even act on those
insights as well, such as coming up with a new product blueprint/plan, building tailor-

automating manual, repetitive business processes.
All in all, generative AI opens this whole plethora of business optimization,
development, and implementation. Through its generative capabilities, the AI can be
trained to tailor-fit business solutions to current business problems. The sky is the limit
for generative AI; it is only a matter of time whether organizations would trust in
utilizing it or not."
339,S0019,2,"On reddit, I found that a couple of people have actually asked this exact question and many have
responded that generative AI can be used in an innovative way by organizations. First off, one of
the users' response was that AI can be used for marketing products and services by having it
create content. This saves time and it also reduces costs because it will eliminate the need to pay
a person to manually do this. Overall, this improves productivity and increases efficiency. Next,
it can improve customer service by using the generative AI as customer service chatbots. The
bots would be able to respond to customer inquiries, help them with simple problem solving, etc,
and it would be able to do all of this at the speed of light. However, it is worth noting that some
individuals prefer human interaction over automated AI responses. In another Reddit thread, a
user mentioned that generative AI is already being used by many organizations and is being
heavily invested in. They also mentioned how Microsoft has announced an AI integration into
familiar tools. This can consist of AI taking notes for an employee in case a meeting is missed.
Overall, AI can improve employee productivity. AI and humans can work hand in hand to make
better company decisions and increase profits."
340,S0020,2,"Generative AI emerges as a revolutionary force for organizations, presenting
many opportunities for innovation and attaining strategic objectives. One of its
standout capabilities lies in cost reduction. By automating content creation,
encompassing tasks like generating product descriptions and marketing
materials, generative AI can generate substantial cost savings while upholding
content quality. Consider, for instance, a burgeoning tech startup looking to
enhance its customer support operations seamlessly. By integrating generative
AI-powered chatbots, the company efficiently manages a significant influx of
customer inquiries and technical support requests, all with minimal human
intervention. This not only elevates the quality of the customer experience with
swift and precise responses but also significantly reduces the need for added
customer support staff, leading to remarkable cost reductions and heightened
operational efficiency. Generative AI contributes to elevating employee
productivity. It streamlines report generation and data analysis, empowering organizations to process extensive datasets with heightened efficiency. For
instance, in the financial sector, generative AI can swiftly analyze market data
and produce investment reports, speeding up data-informed decision-making and
overall productivity. It&#39;s paramount to underscore the indispensable role of human
oversight. Effectively harnessing generative AI entails addressing ethical
considerations, mitigating bias, and upholding data privacy and security. The
establishment of lucid guidelines and ethical frameworks ensures that generative
AI aligns with an organization&#39;s strategic goals and values while supporting
rigorous standards for content quality, ethical behavior, and compliance with
regulations. (Screenshots Provided)"
341,S0021,2,"Yes, Boris Stokes in his post “What is Generative AI? Everything you
need to know.” Gave an amazing example of how generative AIs work in
a real-world analogy; essentially “Generative AI Models learn from
numerous sets of data and use that knowledge to produce new and original
output by blending the elements from the original data” (...) like a
culinary chef studying and combing new elements and flavors to create an
innovative dish. Organizations can understand consumers with technology
by paying attention to AI responses. With the increasing adoption of these
technologies by Americans and the integration of AI products into daily
life, it becomes crucial for brands to incorporate and create AI-integrated
tools for consumer insights. To effectively comprehend their customer
base, companies should stay connected with this expanding user
community and grasp their requirements and preferences, shaping their
product and marketing strategies accordingly. Leveraging user case
studies and frequency data can offer organizations a structured approach
for determining which features to prioritize in their development efforts
and guiding their research agendas for example; “I would like the popular
vanity mirror” the user responses that are being collected to create an
intelligent fast response for that consumer can be utilized in upcoming
research for current trends that help brands with their sales/ads / and
promotion. Or the placement of current items on their websites. There are
many ways to utilize Generative AI for marketing teams to produce more
leads, sales, and products."
342,S0022,2,"This question is complex yet easy to answer. In simple terms, Yes! Generative AI has many tools
that businesses and organizations can utilize for strategic marketing and goals. As a content
creator myself, I have personally used generative AI for content creation ideas and social media
captions and other ideas. It is great for ideas, however it is not a tool to copy from. Generative AI
platforms can cut costs by eliminating the need for a social marketer or advertisement ideas.
When it comes to customer service you will never be able to eliminate human connections and
personalities, however you can use AI to find data about an organization&#39;s customer. Generative
AI can help with efficiency, surveys, and quick responses for clients. Another aspect generative
AI can help an organization with is product development. This innovation can help create,
design, and consult with all aspects of development. This can relate to saving not only money,
but time. AI runs through databases and can see competition, already existing aspects, and niche
needs. This allows for creative and unique ideas to be generative. In marketing terms this relates
to effective marketing and consumer relevance. All in all, this is a great tool for organizations,
marketers, and production. However, all good things have bad aspects or run into issues. This
means that generative AI may never be 100% accurate, truthful, unique, or have the correct data.
Just like most things, there is a risk that has to be taken into account."
343,S0023,2,"Generative AI can be used for constructive purposes despite the risk it does present. AI finds
creative solutions to long-existing problems by analyzing a culmination of knowledge
unfathomable to humans. Creative focused websites like Adobe Express or Canva have started
to incorporate elements of generative AI in order to have completely unique elements in
amalgamated into standard fonts or templates. If AI can create images based on set
descriptions like in TikTok filters or the aforementioned creative websites, it can also be tasked
to replicate or emulate idiosyncratic solutions to everyday workplace problems."
344,S0024,2,"Question 2: Generative AI can and has been used by a multitude of organizations in
order to facilitate processes, expedited delivery time, and increase productivity within
their operations. One example of a company doing this would be using generative AI to
create a product manual. Many product manuals and their terms of agreement these
days are standardized these days, so using AI to create them would prove to be far more
efficient. In this case of Midjourneys, it's an AI that collects data, asks for input, and
creates a piece of artwork. According to Reddit user vitani88, they linked a post which
claims the CEO of a video game company has opted to use AI in opposition to

this very reason. It produces artwork near instantaneously, compared to artists who must
sketch, align, and color the entire thing which could take hours upon end. Not only that,
it's input and output processes are very simple to use. If you wanted a picture of say, ""a
dog drinking water in a futuristic city"", then you simply type that all out and feed it to the
AI. The AI processes this information, and produces as many as four different kinds of
products at once. Not only that, but after output has been reached, it offers the user if
they would like to tweak the work in any way."

applied in areas like predictive maintenance. By analyzing historical data and sensor inputs, AI
models can predict when machinery or equipment is likely to fail. This enables organizations to
perform maintenance only when necessary, minimizing downtime and reducing overall
operational costs. For instance, a manufacturing company could employ generative AI to
optimize its supply chain, reducing inventory carrying costs and streamlining production
processes. Improved customer service is another strategic benefit. Chatbots powered by
generative AI can offer 24/7 support, answering customer queries and resolving issues promptly.
For instance, e-commerce companies use AI chatbots to assist customers with product
recommendations and order tracking, enhancing the overall shopping experience. Generative AI
can also boost employee productivity. In the software development domain, AI-powered code
generators can automate repetitive coding tasks, allowing developers to focus on more creative
and complex aspects of their work. This accelerates software development and reduces the
time-to-market for new applications. While generative AI has great potential, it's essential for
organizations to address ethical and privacy concerns and ensure responsible use. Moreover, it's
crucial to invest in training and maintaining AI models and continuously adapt to changing needs
and challenges. Successful integration of generative AI into an organization's strategy involves a

347,S0027,2,"Generative AI has an immense potential to be of great significance in the future of our society. Already, many jobs are being automated with the advancement of technology and the technological industrial revolution. Artificial intelligence can have many impacts in different sectors of a business. One way it can have an effect is the aspect of accounting and keeping track of records and data in a certain company or industry. The advancement of artificial intelligence can potentially automate this job and make the accounting of all of the assets and debt/ stockholders equity automatic. This will not only save the company money from salary and time consumption, but it will also eliminate human error, a natural problem that causes companies to lose millions of dollars each year. Artificial intelligence can also progress so much in the future that they may even be able to develop near- perfect personalities. Software and computer engineers may able to create a database or computer that may be able to eliminate factors such as discrimination, racism, or other prejudice factors that we humans face. This can have a huge increase in customer service, as this is a major problem in almost every business and industry today.

strategic purposes. This technology holds the power to reduce product and service costs. By
automating repetitive tasks, (which is where AI thrives) it can do these jobs repeatedly without
failure. The other benefit to AI is that it can be utilized for analyzing data in the marketing
industry as well. It can make informed decisions and recommendations about marketing
strategies for companies to help maximize profits. Another huge bonus to AI for companies is
that it will work for hours on end without tiring and doesn’t require any payment. Therefore, it
lowers operating costs for companies because now we don’t utilize humans to analyze this

increased employee productivity.
1. Cost Reduction: Generative AI has the capabilities to help organizations reduce their product
or service costs through processes called automation and optimization. It is essential to note
that successful cost reduction through automation relies on careful planning, data availability,
and ongoing monitoring. Optimization is an ability in which AI optimizes supply chain
operations which reduces the inventory costs and improves logistics. For example, in
manufacturing, generative AI can be used to design more efficient and lightweight
components, reducing material costs, and improving product performance. By generating
optimized production schedules, AI can help streamline operations, minimize waste, and
reduce manufacturing costs.
2. Improved Customer Service: Generative AI can enhance customer service by enabling
personalized and automated interactions. Things like chatbots powered by generative AI can
provide instant answers to customers questions or handle routine tasks, and even simulate
human-like conversation. This ensures faster response times, 24/7 availability, and a better
customer experience. This allows for actual human operators to be of assistance to more
serious and complex tasks.
3. Employee Productivity: Generative AI can increase employee productivity by automating
repetitive tasks, generating insights, and providing decision support. AI can also assist
employees with their task by retrieving information, scheduling, and allowing them to save
time completing their current workload. AI algorithms can generate reports, perform data
visualizations, and identify patterns, freeing up valuable time for employees to focus on more
strategic tasks. This leads to greater efficiency and better utilization of human resources."
350,S0030,2,"The answer to this question seemed to be a yes. Thanks to Paktimes247, I was able to get an
answer. For cost reduction, generative AI can create automated content generation and supply
chain optimization. Forbes uses AI-powered systems to automatically create news articles and
reports. With this, the company doesn’t have to pay people to create content, and the content can
come out quickly. Walmart uses AI to predict product demand, which helps with understanding
how much inventory is needed, so it saves costs. For improved customer service, AI can help
with chatbots, virtual assistants, personalization, and voice assistants. The Royal Bank of
Scotland uses a chatbot called “Luvo” to answer customer questions instantly. Netflix uses
generative AI to personalize content for people, so they can watch series based on what they
have watched already. Amazon uses Alexa to help users get real time answers to their questions.
For improved overall productivity, generative AI helps with code generation and predictive

maintenance. Microsoft's GitHub Copilot automatically generates code snippets, so this acts as a
catalyst for speeding up the software development process. General Electric uses AI to monitor
performance of equipment, so they can identify issues earlier, which allows for improving
productivity."
351,S0031,2,"Generative AI can be used in an innovative way by organizations for strategic purposes
because it can reduce service cost by not having to hire humans and can improve
customer service by keeping interactions simple and quickly, however I am not sure if it
would make customers happy because some customers value and appreciate human
interaction. Older customers may also not know how to use technology that well, so it
actually makes things harder for them."

353,S0033,2,"AI is already starting to slowly replace many human jobs within the workforce.
Currently, AI is only capable of so much, but as time goes on AI will become more advanced,
meaning that more jobs will be taken over by these programs. From the reddit post pictured
below, many companies have already been transitioning there customer service to being ran by
Artificial Intelligence. This displaces thousands of jobs from people working in customer service
centers throughout the world. AI is capable of understanding and directing people in order to
solve there unique problems. However, many people have complained that replacing people with
AI actually has not improved the overall customer experience. AI for customer service at times
can be very buggy and not work as well as just talking to a real person over the phone. The AI
will improve over time as the code continues to evolve and improve. However, in the meantime
it seems as if AI for customer service is less efficient for the customers, but way more efficient
for the business owners. As AI keeps progressing it will take over many other industries sooner
rather than later. For example, Artificial Intelligence is already being used in place of many entry
level attorneys and is used as a research tool for higher level attorneys."
354,S0034,2,"Q2: These next few answers come from a user called EmergencyTip675. Emergency main point
is that generative AI is being used to reduce cost within the company. Things like AI driven chat
boxes help the area of reducing and improving customer service for companies. With AI driven
chat boxes, now there is no need to hire more humans to help monitor and telegraph each person.
Now an AI can come in and assist people with designated answers that are set up. If an AI chat
box isn’t able to answer the user's question for being too complex, then they are sent to talk to a
human representative to help that person solve their problem. Another notable way AI is being
used in companies is that they are producing information that shows employee productivity. This
is going to allow managers and higher ups to analyze the presented information and make
decisions to make tasks more efficient. Eliminating weaknesses that take away from more
important tasks or add more support to tasks that need it. Some companies that are already
applying this are Amazon with their shipping business. AI watches and gives pointers on how to
improve their shipping and handling, since Amazon proudly stands on their one day shipping
statement. Closing unnecessary gaps in the process can really help them stay ahead of the game
and even bring more resources to other company’s tasks, expanding and creating more
innovation for Amazon."

help improve organizational performance in many aspects. AI can be useful in many areas, including

reducing product/service costs, improving customer service, increasing employee productivity, and
gaining a competitive edge in the marketplace. Generative AI plays a major role in automating routine
and repetitive tasks. This allows human employees to spend more time on more strategic activities. It can
also be used to generate individualized marketing content, enabling personalized communications tailored
to customer needs. In production design and quality control, AI can also extract patterns from large
amounts of data to help optimize processes. Predictive analytics improves market trends and demand
forecasting, optimizes supply chain management, and enables efficient inventory management.
AI can also help improve employee productivity. By automating tasks and analyzing data, business
processes can be streamlined and employees can focus on more strategic tasks. However, the use of AI
also requires careful attention to ethical aspects. Protecting data privacy, ensuring transparency, and
preventing bias are all important. In addition, AI systems require continuous monitoring and fine-tuning,

356,S0036,2,"Generative AI can be used in innovative way by organizations to reduce cost of goods,
improve customer service and to improve employee productivity among many other things.
A use of Generative AI in organizations is that of a personal assistant; it can be prompted
by a summary of an organizations intended goal or idea to complete certain tasks or to provide
alternative ideas. Staff can use it to assist with coding, renovating product lines, writing product
descriptions, and finding competitive pricing models.
One use is to improve videos and written content. It can be used to edit both videos and
written media; in addition to editing, it can suggest or identify ways to improve or to shorten the
media and still send the same message to consumers. It can also help organizations in creating
advertisement.
Generative AI can also automate several routine tasks saving the organization resources.
It can be used by staff in organizations to draft, write or edit emails; it can also respond to calls
and gather information on clients/set up appointments. Generative AI can also be used as a
chatbot, helping solve many customer concerns without the use of extra staff.
It can also be used by organizations to analyze data about themselves and competitors.
Analyzing data on competitors can help organizations learn about their performance and gain

ideas on what to improve. Data can be analyzed to identify weaknesses and strategies to improve
organizations.
Another use is improving customer organizational experience; it can provide customers
with personal recommendations and serve as a fraud detection for organizations. Content can be
moderated and labeled so that users or customers are more comfortable engaging in with the
organization. Organizations can gain deeper knowledge on customers to create customer
segmentations and promote data driven products to increase profits."

Instead of actual employees who require continuous hourly wages, AI doesn&#39;t require
that hourly costs after the initial payment. There is a possibility of some maintenance
expenses over time, but these are overall below the ongoing salary for
workers/employees. Because of this, AI generally reduces operational costs in the long
run, making it a potential option for businesses aiming to minimize their expenses and
maximize their profits."
358,S0038,2,"Generative AI can be used in an innovative way by organizations for different purposes. There
are many variations of what Generative AI can do and how it may be used strategically in a
business scope. Some of these things include but are not limited to reducing product or service
cost, enhancing customer service, boost employee productivity, and offer new revenue streams.
Generative AI can design new potential product variations or alter existing products and their
designs. Another strategic purpose that AI can be used for include constructing tailored content
that makes personalized recommendations based on individual preferences. Many companies
have begun to implement these strategies into their websites. For example, virtual chat boxes are
AI-Driven bots that can offer recommendations based on personalized content and individual
preferences. Some other examples of what AI can do includes training and development. They

can customize certain training modules ensuring that the individual is learning in the most
efficient way possible. Generative AI can also produce new revenue streams such as custom

360,S0040,2,"○ The future of AI in medicine is a topic of huge interest and with lots of potential.
As research and innovation grow in machine learning and deep learning,
healthcare stands on the peak of a huge change. An idea that was discussed

here is the automation of diagnosis and treatment for diseases like Tuberculosis
and Diabetes, particularly at primary healthcare setups. By gathering
comprehensive data on symptoms, signs, and management, there&#39;s potential for
AI to significantly support physicians and other health professionals.
In the discussion, the vision was extended to analyzing non-radiological data like
heart murmurs and grading pain. With software centralization, widespread
deployment of AI tools could become a reality with the main challenge being data
input methods and cloud processing. Yet, the challenges are considerable. Key
among them is data aggregation, including issues of noise reduction, input
variability, and labeling bias.
The biggest challenge in healthcare AI is the accessibility to data and
interpretation. Electronic Health Records (EHR), is a huge jump from traditional
paper systems. Due to this, it contains inconsistencies and are not always AI-
friendly or compatible. Much of the current data is in free-text or designed
primarily for billing, that makes it hard for AI to process. Although, there is
potential for new techniques like Natural Language Processing (NLP) that could
revolutionize data extraction from EHRs. What I learned is that there seems to be
a future the we will see with a blend of AI and human physicians, with AI
streamlining tasks and supporting clinical decisions."
361,S0041,2,"Yes, generative AI can be used in an innovative way by organizations for strategic purposes,
such as reducing product, improving customer service and more. Generative AI can be used to
automate repetitive tasks and time consuming tasks. This can mean that generative AI can be
used for customer service as implementing chat bots powered by generative AI that can handle
easier inquiries from customers that generally do not need a human to help them. Generatie AI
chatbots can also be used 24/7, compared to a human needing to sleep and have breaks. This
would mean that humans can handle the more complex issues that may be requested by
customers. This would also help in customer service efficiency and would help reduce
operational costs. Generative AI can also be used to help marketing that can be targeted to a
more specific audience, from analyzing customer data. This would help reduce marketing costs
and would also help avoid wrong target audiences and generic campaign ideas. Generative AI
can also be used to use predictive analytics by having that AI analyze older data and use it to
make predictions on customer behavior and future trends that can happen. With all Generative AI
can do, it can also increase employee productivity by allowing the AI to help analyze data,
automate tasks that might have taken a human hours or days. However, even if AI can do all this,

362,S0042,2,"Yes, generative AI can be used in an innovative way by organizations for strategic
purposes. Why? Well, to boil it down simply it can be used to efficiently make the organization
be more productive. With the three given prompts, let me explain further why AI can be used in
an innovative way for strategic purposes. First, with product/service costs we all know that it can
be tedious to do cost reductions as one single mistake can cost the entire program. However, with
AI, it can help reduce that burden by doing the repetitive mundane tasks that is often done by
humans much faster than the workers; take auto (automatic) battling in many video games, it is
often implemented to help the consumer (player) to redo the tedious task of grinding (doing the
same set of actions in order to achieve a result) for experience to level up in a game. In the
strategic purpose terms, AI can help lessen the burden of cost reductions by automating the
repetitive tasks that are usually done by the workers in order to save time and resources.
Second, with improving customer satisfaction/service, AI can help by streamlining the
process and reducing the cost of burden that would normally go to workers in a company and as
well as reduce the usages of resources. Such as using a chatbot to answer simple questions on
certain things much like how a wide variety of companies are doing now, like Amazon,
newsletters, one such example would also be the UNLV library website as it has a chatbot to help
students find whatever academia they need for their courses. Lastly, for improving employment
productivity, AI can also be used to streamline this process to the employees in companies.
How? Well by giving employees more to work with in real time thus also improving efficiency
in the company. One such peculiar instance of this is by using AI to help game developers code a
game, while AI can code with the help of training, it can also be of help to game developers by
giving them the data they need to create a game such as how the physics works in an adventure
game, the spatial awareness of FPS (First player shooter) games, and so on and so for."
363,S0043,2,"Generative AI offers a transformative potential for various organizational aspects and can
play a pivotal role in advancing strategic goals. Businesses can harness generative AI to
streamline their content creation processes. This includes generating marketing content
such as blog posts, social media updates, and advertising copy. The advantage extends
beyond saving time and resources; it also ensures a consistent brand voice across all
communication channels.
Moreover, the integration of generative AI-powered chatbots has the capacity to
significantly enhance customer service. These sophisticated bots possess the ability to not
only comprehend and respond to customer inquiries but also provide detailed information
about products or services. They can even assist with straightforward problem-solving,

Generative AI's unique capability to analyze extensive datasets and uncover patterns and
trends has a direct impact on strategic decision-making within organizations. For
instance, it can effectively examine consumer feedback and provide valuable insights into
product updates and market trends. This data-driven approach empowers companies to
make well-informed decisions that can have far-reaching implications for their strategic
direction.
In essence, generative AI has the potential to revolutionize numerous facets of an
organization, enabling the creation of marketing content, improving customer service
through chatbots, and facilitating data-driven strategic decisions. This comprehensive

utilization not only streamlines operations but also drives businesses towards their
strategic objectives.

improving customer service, and improving employee productivity. Firstly, products and services
can be optimized with generative AI – greatly reducing costs. If given a detailed run-down of a
product/service along with a request for potential improvements, AI may suggest improvements
for sales price, materials, design, and much more. This information is sourced from statistics or
expansive information equivalent to an expert on the topic, thus being able to reduce costs.
Secondly, AI can be used to generate human-like, professional, accurate responses to customers
across a variety of situations. The responses are void of emotion which is even more helpful for
dealing with upset customers as humans may potentially respond with emotional bias. Lastly,
generative AI may be used to handle time-consuming work of employees much faster, freeing
them up for other tasks. A great example provided in the OKC was the marketing industry.

significant changes to humanity that many will have to try and adjust to it. AI will become a
necessity for an enterprise&#39;s survival. AI is no longer an option, though it will become necessary
for future survival. The accessibility of digital information will be the only limitation inhibiting
AI&#39;s growth. He also mentioned that we will all witness an adaptation of AI in various forms of
new digital products and services, and he called it the “AI of things.” AI will be a successful
strategy and a necessity. Accessibility to digital information is the only limitation that will inhibit
the growth of AI worldwide. It must accelerate its digital transformation programs to utilize AI
technology effectively. According to a survey, organizations today estimate that thirty-four
percent of all business-related tasks are performed by machines, with the remaining sixty-six
percent performed by humans. Generative AI will impact jobs broadly by filling the cognitive

gaps in the enterprise workflows such as policy interpretations, risk management, repeatable
decisions, content drafting and validation, classification, answering questions, researching,
summarizing, and more can be replaced by a generative AI. Complimentary productivity booster,
is another because as technology rapidly advances, so will our ability to streamline certain job
functions. Generative AI tools can help to augment temporary labor during seasonal peaks in
business which reduces labor costs. It can also substitute for job elimination, businesses can take
advantage of the power of generative AI to improve efficiency, the ability to train AI models
using historical domain-specific information and high-cost functions can be automated with AI
bots, can reduce the need for human intervention. Lowering the entry barriers for jobs is good for
businesses as AI can assist remotely online repair technicians and call center agents, which many
companies hire HR advisors the work with employees to address their queries on policies and
workplace issues."
366,S0046,2,"AI is very beneficial for a company or organization’s strategic purposes. It can help with
organizing and preparing statistical data to raise marketing quality. Its ability to speed data
administration and analysis, particularly in the field of marketing, is one of its primary
advantages. Its useful resources cut across many industries and have a significant impact on
how firms run. AI technology can improve decision-making and optimize jobs, all of which help
to reduce product/service cost and boost overall effectiveness. In addition, the first screenshot
also discusses how it has the ability to improve customer service. AI chatbots represent a huge
improvement in customer service by providing quick and tailored solutions to queries. This not
just increases customer happiness but also allows the organization to receive feedback on their
products or services. To add on, the ability of AI to translate multilingual content is transforming
internal global communication in organizations. This feature makes it easier for employees with
different linguistic backgrounds to work together seamlessly and increases an organization's
exposure to a larger, global audience. These features that are offered by generative AI can
innovatively improve an organization immensely. Organizations could modify their operations,
goods, and services by inventively implementing generative AI, resulting in more effective
product/service cost, improved customer experiences, and an improved employee productivity
in their respective markets."
367,S0047,2,"Generative AI can indeed be leveraged innovatively by organizations to achieve strategic
objectives. By employing generative AI, organizations can reduce product or service costs
through streamlined design processes. For instance, using generative design in manufacturing
can optimize product designs, minimizing material usage and production costs, thereby
enhancing overall cost efficiency. As well as anomaly detection (fraud or network intrusion),
image super resolution, face detection, and tracking. AI can be incorporated into almost any
business depending on their needs.
Moreover, in terms of customer service, generative AI-powered chatbots can provide
personalized and efficient customer support, addressing common queries promptly. These
chatbots can simulate human-like conversations, offering real-time assistance to customers,
thereby improving the overall customer service experience. In the context of employee
productivity, generative AI can automate repetitive tasks, allowing employees to focus on more
complex and creative responsibilities. For example, automating data entry processes through AI-

powered tools can significantly reduce the time spent on mundane tasks, enabling employees to

allocate their efforts toward higher-value tasks that require human intelligence and decision-
making.

In summary, generative AI offers significant potential for organizations to streamline processes,
enhance customer experiences, and optimize employee productivity. Its ability to automate tasks
and generate tailored solutions fosters efficiency and innovation."
368,S0048,2,"Summary:
I can relate because I'm also a beginner in the AI world, not knowing much about it. I started with taking
information system college courses to get basics down but there are lots other courses that focus on
different aspects of technology, these have been the most useful as they provide tons of resources and
additional support if needed. YouTube and Linkedin learning also have tons of AI information which has
helped me the most, they provide step by step and hands on learning that allow you to learn at your own
pace. Joining communities like this Reddit page to stay updated with relevant information and ask
questions is also very important, some people can be experts or have more experience when dealing with
this process. Someone mentioned that background and goals are crucial to understanding AI, this can help
in what area of AI you want to focus on. And as mentioned, those who have a programming, math or
statistics background are better at understanding algorithms. The AI world is only getting bigger and
constantly changing so learning can play a big process and as a beginner establishing goals is most
important and will help in the learning path you want to take."
369,S0049,2,"Generative AI is a transformative tool that organizations can deploy innovatively to
achieve strategic goals, such as reducing costs, enhancing customer service, and boosting
employee productivity. Mukund from Quora insists that the AI excels in automating repetitive
tasks, like chatbots handling routine customer inquiries, effectively trimming operational costs
and improving service efficiency. Moreover, its ability to generate highly personalized marketing
content through the analysis of extensive customer data allows organizations to target audiences
more effectively, thus lowering marketing costs while increasing conversion rates. In product

development, it aids in design prototyping and optimizing manufacturing processes, leading to
cost reduction and faster product launches. Content creation, powered by AI, not only lowers
content creation costs but ensures a consistent flow of material across various industries.
Additionally, its predictive analytics capabilities assist in optimizing operations by
making future trend predictions, which, in turn, helps reduce unnecessary expenses. By
enhancing employee productivity and offering supply chain optimization, generative AI proves
valuable across the organizational spectrum. It&#39;s instrumental in quality assurance, automating
defect detection, and in cybersecurity, where it identifies and counters threats, safeguarding an
organization&#39;s assets and reducing potential financial repercussions. Generative AI&#39;s versatility,
however, necessitates ethical use and human oversight to maintain quality and prevent misuse."
370,S0050,2,"I posted a question in reddit about how many uses AI in organizations. Two people responded
and said their companies currently use AI for cost reduction, improving customer service,
enhancing employee productivity, and optimizing order placements. AI can help factory
industries track and predict when a piece of equipment will require maintenance. Some use AI
to handle supply chain needs such as minimizing inventory costs as well as better tracking of
that inventory. I can imagine that AI can be used for coming up with ways to better engage the
customer since the people who responded said it helps with customer service. This must be
because of sentiment analysis which monitors social media and customer feedback. I am sure
that allows the AI to create personalized ads for each specific customer that clicks on the
website. They say that AI can handle routine customer inquiries, while storing the consumers
data to provide personalized help. AI can be used to free up employees by automating tedious
or remedial tasks that are simple. AI has also been used to help collect important data that
allows the company to be more specific when they are looking to innovate."
371,S0051,2,"Q2. The conversation centered on the potential applications of generative AI within
organizations for strategic purposes. It was noted that while the technology can be leveraged to
reduce product or service costs, enhance customer service, and boost employee productivity, it
currently faces the challenge of producing unreliable, fabricated information, necessitating
human evaluation. Despite this limitation, generative AI demonstrates its utility in the preliminary
stages of projects, such as generating image sketches for creative industries or presenting
concepts to management. However, due to the complex implementation process, smaller
organizations seeking readily accessible solutions may find the current pipeline cumbersome
and less feasible. generative AI holds promise for organizations to streamline operations and
improve various aspects of their business, including cost reduction and enhancing service
quality. Although its current reliability is limited, the technology can still be instrumental in the
initial phases of project development, offering valuable assistance in creative brainstorming and
idea presentation, particularly for larger enterprises with the capacity for human oversight.
However, smaller organizations may encounter challenges in adopting generative AI due to the
complexities involved in its application, particularly in its current developmental stage."
372,S0052,2,"Generative AI can be used by organizations for strategic purposes, especially in regard to
reducing product/service costs, improving customer service, and improving employee
productivity.

First, considering any changes to the product/service and improving customer service, it
is essential we consider how business is conducted as a process. As things move through the
cycle, steps need to be completed before another step begins with time being of the essence.
Let’s walk through an example: creating a chatbot to help customers ask questions and handle
customer complaints. By training a model on relevant data sets, ChatGPT would be able to move
processes into completion. To further the example, let’s say a customer has a hard time finding
an itemized bill in their account. If the customer inputs: “Itemized Bill” into the chat box, the
model would be able to go through the customer’s account and easily pull up the itemized bill in
question. Comparing this traditional telephone hotline call, the chat bot can save money and
time for the company. Costs such as call center office/space rent and salary for call center
representatives are drastically decreased. In addition, completing actions like this online can
typically less time-consuming as well.
Considering employee productivity, employees can tilize ChatGPT when coding or using
Microsoft Excel. Both coding and Excel can be a time-consuming tedious process. However,
ChatGPT can help integrate the use of automation and develop formulas to keep codes and Excel
sheets constantly updated. When difficulties become relevant in a project, it can increase project
working time and postpone completion."

374,S0054,2,"Yes, generative AI can be used for innovation by
organizations in a variety of different ways. Generative AI can be used to innovate organizations
because it can be programmed to complete any task it just has to have the correct training. To
help reduce product cost the generative AI can predict maintenance needed on machines.
Given the machine&#39;s history, usage rate, and current condition the AI can use probability to give
accurate information on when the machine will need maintenance. Which not only will prevent
costly equipment failures, but also make it safer for the workers who are using the machine
everyday. Generative AI is already used by some businesses to help improve customer service.
For example Bank of America has an AI virtual assistant that can help answer questions you
may have at any given time of the day. This is not only useful for the customers because they
do not have to wait for the bank to be open to get their questions answered, but it also allows
the workers to focus on other tasks. Generative AI can even be used to generate ideas for
employees working on team projects which gives them extra time to work on perfecting the
ideas that they are working on. Asking simple brainstorming questions to AI can be very useful
in opening your eyes to topics you were not thinking about."

376,S0056,2,"- The discussion I came across to answer this question states that generative AI can be used in an
innovative way by organizations, and the organization we will be looking at for this question will
be Google. Google’s use of generative AI to enhance customer experience and satisfaction is a
prime example of this argument. A notable feature right now that Google is implementing is an
AI-powered search experience system.
The discussion thread also discusses this feature in a little more detail through the use of data
expansion. Data expansion is when generative AI can analyze user queries and expand them with
synonyms or contextually relevant keywords. The discussion also points out the concepts of
&quot;auto-tagging&quot; and &quot;categorization,&quot; which ultimately makes it easier for search engines to
organize and present results in a structured manner when content is tagged and categorized. To
get more clarity, I went ahead and did a little outside research and discovered a related
technology unveiled very recently on August 15, 2023. Google introduced SGE, their AI-
powered Search Experience System, and it enables users to hover over certain words to preview
definitions, see diagrams, and see related images (Ajao 1). Ultimately, this innovation redefines
how users interact with Google while improving their service and enhancing the customer
experience at the same time.

377,S0057,2,"Yes, generative AI can reduce cost by eliminating the human element from the cost of a product or service. A huge part of a companies cost can be found in the overhead for the management of people. AI will reduce the amount of people at a company, thus reducing direct wages, and less required work for HR and other departments. AI is also great at making connection to data that is too huge or overwhelming to connect. For example, medical AI can look at a diagnosis and symptom from patients around the world, and make a connection that a human could not without the aid of AI.
It can improve a customer experience by helping a company communicate to its customers in a more effective way with grammar and tone corrections in emails and messages. AI can even answer calls and gather information on customer calls to more quickly and effectively. It can be used for more effective automatic chats for a quicker and more effective use of time. It can also increase employee productivity by providing complex, technical answers to questions to any employee at any time, reducing the need for subject matter experts. AI is able to help those with little experience get results for hard programing answers just by asking for an output.
"
378,S0058,2,"Generative AI can definitely be used innovatively and for strategic purposes. It can make parts of
the, especially creative, process of providing a product or service much easier. This would allow for that
process to direct energy to additional things and for workers to bear less load. An optimized version of
some the things generative AI can do (or is trying to do at a quickly improving rate) is help with
finding/summarizing research, generating quick simulations and visualizations of an idea, forming quick
inspiration for new creations, etc. All of this creates a steady and consistent flow of ideas and samples
that might not exist to the organization otherwise. This frees up a lot of time and energy that, in the
past, might have been spent trying to brainstorm or visualize things from nothing. A lot of the posts from
the subreddit community I joined pointed out jobs with a lot of data interpretation as something that
would benefit from generative AI. For example, a lawyer that wants to cross reference a current case
with an old one could do so with AI technology. Generative AI could take key phrases/information from
what is inputted by someone in the firm and output historic data or patterns from old cases (as well as
lists of the cases themselves)."
379,S0059,2,"Yes, generative AI is used in an innovative way by numerous companies. One article mentioned
in the future all software interfaces that may be hard to use for certain people will be simplified
by generative AI based on what you struggled with. This would enhance our software
experience which will in return increase productivity. If this innovative idea were to happen,

people’s relationship with technology would change drastically. Using generative AI can also
boost people&#39;s performance in idean and content creation. Many people see AI as completely
taking over a job, but it can also just be used as a helping hand to enhance one’s own
capabilities. Another way I learned for companies to reduce service costs and possibly increase
customer satisfaction is through an AI model for high-resolution computer vision. This powerful
computer vision can pick up every pixel, recognize the object, and categorize them. This model
can be used for autonomous vehicles and improve its ability to react quickly and improve its
decision-making qualities. For delivery companies, this would save the cost of having to pay a
driver and could get the product to its destination faster because it does need to stop or take
breaks like a human would."
380,S0060,2,"Generative AI in businesses may be incorporated as a means of efficiency improvement since
AI develops information at a rapid speed in comparison to a human. It can also be used in
industries and businesses that produce media—AI can be implemented to create writing,
painting, songs, etc. One Redditor stated they utilize Generative AI in their workplace for scripts,
website content, emails, blog posts, etc. They said it essentially removes the role of a copywriter
and “knocks down the workload by 90%.”

Edra 4

As the Redditor stated, People can use AI as sample models to build upon, and humans can
edit these products to make them more human-like. Using this process would reduce the
workload and time it takes to create quality products completely from scratch.
This could also be used in the reversed method, humans can generate a draft or sketch and the
AI can utilize that information to generate a final and more complete product. For example,
another Redditor provided an article link that explains how businesses may benefit from
Generative AI. In one example, the user (human) provides a sketch and the Generative AI uses
the sketch to develop a “synthesized image.”

Edra 5
In this sense, Generative AI can help businesses create products from scratch and build upon it
from there or they can create a draft and AI can provide a more complete product. It eliminates
the need for more labor and reduces the time and effort it takes to finish a product."
381,S0061,2,"I think generative AI will help organizations and businesses improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of the daily tasks at hand. The same way happens every time there is innovation
in science and technology. They can utilize artificial intelligence in a way that matches their
business needs to minimize costs associated with certain processes that would otherwise
require human labor. One example is the use of Generative AI in marketing. Nowadays, artificial
intelligence has been programmed to create designs and product descriptions to be used in
social media posts. It can also be used to write scripts or articles for the marketing team instead
of hiring copywriters. It helps the company save labor costs and time that would have been
spent by a marketing team or a graphic designer.
Generative AI can also optimize supply chain management by forecasting demands. Another
use will be for the automation of inventory management which will help increase efficiency and
reduce manual input. Overall, generative AI has the potential to revolutionize the way
businesses operate and reduce product or service costs. On the other hand, artificial
intelligence can also be used in improving customer service or improving productivity by
interlacing AI into systems that are operated by voice commands and could make account
changes easier For me if AI is used concurrently in a call center systems, troubleshooting or any
customer concerns could be resolved right away. An example I think is when companies utilize
chatbots before redirecting any concerns to the actual human operators. Chatbots could offer
basic troubleshooting or solutions and if it worsens, then a human interception would be needed
but it avoids spending too much time with a representative."

and more. For example, in my job at Amazon, Leaders use chatbots to use it to increase
productivity and they use them to gain customer experience. Also, another example is Why
hasn’t anyone come to the regular gas stations and why do they like to go to Costco or Sam&#39;s
Club to get gas instead? The reason is that the prices in the regular gas stations are very high and
Costco/Samsclub has very fair prices to fill their car up to the price they are used to which is
another example of Product/Service cost, and Gas price is a service cost. Now for the product
cost, you want to get let’s say a Brand-New Television but the price is not exactly what you

your arguments.
Yes, Generative AI is currently being used for a variety of strategic purposes and the
limits of what it can do are constantly being expanded. The most widely used functions for it are
in the areas of Customer Relationship Management (CMR) and content creation. When it comes
to CMR generative AI can keep track of customer preferences and recommend products based on
a number of factors that it collects from each customer. It can create marketing content and
messages, and figure out what customers to send these messages to. It is also used for customer
service applications---which is something were all familiar with---through the use of chat boxes
that provide solutions to customers in response to their issues. An example, provided by a user

from the r/ProductManagement subreddit, is the use of AI when it comes to recommending new
products to a customer based on their past data. They state that a typical stats model, manually
created by a worker, would not be able to keep up with the influx of new products, whereas the
AI model would instantly detect the new product and match it up to a customer likely to buy it.
Generative AI boosts employee productivity because it takes care of time consuming tasks and
allows them to focus on other tasks with the time saved by using AI. A user from the subreddit
who is in the radiation oncology industry, states that an AI program they use to draw organs is
able to create these pictures in 2 minutes or less whereas it would take a medical professional
“30-180 minutes.” Overall, Generative AI is used in a variety of applications that not only helps
businesses work more efficiently but also makes employees’ lives easier."
385,S0065,2,"Generative AI can strategically be used in business and other organization settings to improve
performance and customer satisfaction. As one of the comments in the above thread suggests, AI
can be used to replace customer support agents. This cuts down costs in having to employ
customer service representatives and can be used to provide more efficient service. A customer
does not have to wait in a queue to speak to a live representative and can have their questions
answered almost instantaneously through the use of chatbots. Specialized software is available
that allows businesses to feed information to an AI in order to provide adequate information to
frequently asked questions or scenarios. However, there are some limitations on to what degree
generative AI can be employed in business settings. For instance, although customer service
chatbots are helpful, setting them up requires a learning curve and time from organizers to be
able to feed this information to the AI. This ensures that the information it provides to customers
is correct and leaves them with a satisfying experience. Additionally, a company cannot fully get

The article showed that AI is making remarkable moves particularly in the banking and finance industry. I
can attest to this since I work in finance currently for my career. Banking is utilizing AI in general to help
with their regular processes and make them more streamlined. Becoming more streamlined will help
reduce product/service cost as well as improve overall customer satisfaction. In the article, it quotes
how banks are projected to save with AI apps. “nearly 80% of banks are aware of the potential benefits
that AI presents to their sector, and banks are projected to save $447 billion by 2023 by using AI apps. In
regard to AI improving employee productivity, I will say that I’m on the fence with it.  While it helps the
employee, will it take away their job function entirely down the line? While it’s an evolving and complex
issue, it’s in the current stages of transforming and helping human jobs. It will also begin to develop new
job opportunities that will be shaped around areas that are required with unique human skills."
388,S0068,2,"I do believe that AI can be used in an innovative way by organizations for strategic
purposes in multiple ways. It has been used in a customer service capacity in recent
years on websites with chatbots to navigate customers to where they need to go to a
website or even connect them to a customer service representative with a preface to the
employee of the situation to help alleviate the stress of the customer. This helps shorten
wait times for these representatives if customers can be helped with any minor and
easily fixed issues. I have also seen it in my own industry in the nonprofit sector for
innovative use for employee productivity. On the already shoestring budgets nonprofits
work with generative AI can pump out effective campaigning verbiage that can be used
from anything to social media posts to full on acknowledgement and gratitude letters for
donors. Or even, more simply, a free self editing tool to create stronger writing. This is
great because it allows more time to be allocated to the employees to focus on more
tedious tasks such as report pulling and analyzing for the communities they serve, and
recognize what more can be done. I do not believe generative AI can completely take

over operational processes, but it can certainly help give employees a template and
hand in starting such things so they can go over and do finishing touches themselves."
389,S0069,2,"Question #2: Generative AI can be used in multiple innovative ways pertaining to improving
organizations. In an article posted by a group user, author Azamat Abdoullaev says, “AI is

support, freeing up human resources to focus on more complex and strategic activities. This not
only improves efficiency but also reduces operational costs and enhances overall productivity.”
(BBN Times, 2023) The use of this technology has been known to improve customer satisfaction
in their experiences with certain businesses. AI can provide the same personalized services
online as a human being doing the same job. It can produce instant feedback and answers to
customer questions/concerns. It can study customer data, as well as statistics regarding
engagement. Examples of Generative AI in businesses are online Chatbots or virtual assistants
usually easily located on a business’s webpage. Abdoullaev provides a great example of using
artificial intelligence in healthcare. He voices that AI can improve diagnostics, treatment
planning, and patient care. AI algorithms can analyze medical images, detect anomalies, and
assist in disease diagnosis. This can help enhance healthcare delivery, reduce errors, and improve
patient outcomes. (Abdoullaev, 2023)"
390,S0070,2,"With many people around the world constantly putting in dozens of work hours each day to perform the needed tasks to keep each business running, generative AI could be the tool to free up some of our time and resources. Looking at aspects such as advertising AI would be able to take the gathered information about the different market segments and tailor each message to a specific market. These messages could include social media posts, blogs, or even a whole campaign ad. All of these aid as a creative collaborator to the employees, flourishing them with new ideas left and right. While these are helpful it is the refining of these ads that improve our retention and success. Generative AI can make testing and adjusting the content easier by creating multiple versions of each source of content and changing slight aspects of them that allow us to point out what each individual market resonates with more. Leaving the employees with more free time they would be able to monitor the day-to-day operations as well as ensuring that the AI outputs are examined for maximum success.

the work rather than spending money on a human creator&#39;s work. I view this new type of
innovation as a double-bladed sword as on the one hand, AI has begun to do some incredible
things like in an Art piece that was considered for an award but was rescinded once the truth

Generative AI can be used in an innovative way by organizations for strategic purposes. One-way it
could be used is to increase human labor and therefore provide a more productive and efficient
workplace. An example is streamlining workflows. When workers let generative AI do repetitive tasks,
they are able to focus more on tasks that are more challenging and those that require creativity. Another
possibility is that workers could use generative AI like ChatGPT to write emails, posts, and summarize
long documents. Likewise, generative AI like Bard helps employees get information quickly and
therefore decreases their search time for other things. Furthermore, some workers could use it to
brainstorm ideas and find inspiration. 
     Some organizations may use generative AI to understand different products and the industry, which
could reduce product or service costs. Similarly, organizations could cut costs by depending on AI to
create ideas for their webpage layout. By doing so, they don’t have to depend on an artist. Additionally,
they could use generative AI to improve competitive analysis and persona development.
    Lastly, generative AI could be used to improve customer service. The worker might have the
responsibility of writing to customers. When the worker has an idea of what they want to point out but

generative AI with impressive results to boost talent-hiring within its company as per one report
It is not hard to see why this can be a possibility for other organizations as well that are on the
lookout for boosting productivity and growth."
395,S0075,2,"Apparently it has already begun and is far more down the line in that regard than
most individuals somewhat following the topic would
know. Companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft,
Bing, Nvidia and many more are already throwing
massive amounts of money to invest into the
Generative AI boom. Companies as large as the ones
listed are finding is to be incredibly useful by
combining it with already existing human expertise in
order to better decision making and in the simplest
terms to amplify the profits of the company. The
individual does go on to state that for the most basic
cases it is being used for mundane tasks. They are
creating a database of company knowledge that allows
much easier access for their employees to complete
and receive help for many different tasks. But there is
a downside to this generative ai boom. It is fully possible that within a few decades, maybe even
sooner, that these systems will be so advanced to the point of no return for many jobs.
Companies will have the opportunity to not pay employees for what were once important tasks
that can now be accomplished much more efficiently by ai at a much cheaper rate. This will
likely cause great pain for many Americans due to the possible skyrocketing unemployment."
396,S0076,2,"Question 2: Generative AI opens exciting possibilities for organizations looking to
innovate and meet their goals. It&#39;s like having a digital assistant that can help in many ways. For
example, it can take on tasks like creating product descriptions or marketing content, saving time
and money. Imagine having a friendly AI chatbot available 24/7 (much like ChatGPT like I
stated earlier) to answer common customer questions and make their experience better. Also, it
can be a great teammate for employees, quickly crunching data to help them to make smarter
decisions. And who doesn&#39;t love personalized recommendations that make using a service more
enjoyable? It can even be your creative brainstorming buddy, suggesting fresh ideas for your
projects. Just remember, while AI is fantastic, we should always think about things like

copyright and making sure we keep that human touch. Almost like the beginning of the first
question, though this is a learning technology, humans have a crucial role to play.
I also think that this can be answered much like the second half of questions 1 answer.
This Generative AI can give assistance that can help, but according to that last post it can also
cause unemployment. Currently there are no real examples of this technology causing an
employee to quit their job. There is a lawsuit going on currently though towards Microsoft for
reproducing open-source code from co-pilot without proper attribution or license compliance."
397,S0077,2,"Can organizations use generative AI in innovative ways to achieve strategic ends? I
think so. According to the content provided by ChatGpt, artificial intelligence can
indeed reduce costs, improve customer service, and increase employee productivity.
I think the most important reason is that artificial intelligence removes traditional
processes. For example, in traditional work, people need to do it. However, with the
rise of artificial intelligence, this job is replaced by artificial intelligence, and workers
only need to supervise that the final results meet the standards. In theory, artificial
intelligence optimizes the process and reduces costs. The same goes for customer
service, which will allow the company to effectively utilize human resources.
However, I think ChatGPT is wrong here. The purpose of robots and virtual
assistants should be to simplify the process. Imagine how many employees are
needed to handle the process at the same time if there are hundreds of customers.
However, with the addition of artificial intelligence, it can screen specific groups of
people and assign them to specific departments, thereby reducing the time and
human resources. Finally, because AI replaces simple and repetitive works,

employees only need to pay attention to whether the results meet standards and use
the extra time to deal with other things, thereby increasing productivity."
398,S0078,2,"An interesting comment that I saw while trying to answer this question was that
innovation is not the same as invention. I think this is very important to mention because
Generative AI as a whole is not a new invention it is ultimately something that was
created out of an improvement of a current system. So for organizations to use
Generative AI in an innovative way, they are looking to improve a system or task that is

currently in place. I believe that Generative AI can be used in an innovative way by
organizations. I believe this because any system or task can be improved. The majority
of systems and tasks are not optimized for maximum efficiency and that is where I
believe Generative AI can come in. A good example that I found was employee
productivity. Where Generative AI can help summarize documents so that an employee
can utilize that time reading all the documents by doing something else which improves
productivity. This is a good example of Generative AI being used in an innovative way
because Generative AI can be useful for tasks that aren’t difficult but also take a long
time to complete as well as doing."
399,S0079,2,"Question 2: Generative AI can be used by organizations for strategic purposes. It can help an
organization immensely since it can be used in different ways to grow profit and quality. The
first way an organization can use generative AI is by personalizing marketing. Generative AI can
collect user data and show the user products that fit their preferences. This can increase revenue
since the user will be more inclined to buy the product. You can see in my screenshot a
personalized ad for shampoo that I recently looked up. Another way it can be used is by

automating tasks like in chatbots. Personally, I have seen many organizations, large and small,
use chatbots as a liaison for customer service. It can answer basic questions, which can free up
customer service agents who can answer more difficult questions and make it faster for the user
since they no longer need to call. Supply chains can also benefit from generative AI. It can make
operations flow easier by predicting when demand will be at its highest. This allows the supply
chain to add more personnel if needed and/or increase inventory. One more way it can be used is
in predictive analytics. Organizations rely heavily on forecasting to keep their organizations
thriving. Generative AI can analyze historical data which makes forecasting more accurate."
400,S0080,2,"This question I can confidently answer. Not only did users from the thread provide what I think are
AI-generated responses, but I have firsthand knowledge and experience using generative AI
programs, such as ChatGPT, for business purposes. Based on user answers, AI programs can cut
back on the time a user spends on tasks by developing strategies to solve problems, providing tools
and resources for issues, and, in some cases, as mentioned in one thread, using algorithms to design
components of projects. I use ChatGPT to create social media captions and copy in my own work. I
will give the AI a prompt for a photo or activity I´d like to promote, and then it will write the post
for me. I can tell it what kind of tone to use, how I´d like emojis, and what I would like the audience
to get out of it. I also use it to save me time on writing lengthy emails that outline specific items of a
lease agreement or to answer questions in a more professional and unbiased tone that will answer a
resident or prospect´s question without spending too much time on it. This saves my company
money, as I am using my time and resources on bigger projects that are more of a priority. The
second screenshot below shows some of the content my property has posted recently, provided by
AI, after using prompts from myself or staff. I also use AI in my freelance business to help with
social media content and digital content creation. A screenshot of one of my LinkedIn posts is
included."
401,S0081,2,"Generative AI can be used to find new and innovative ways to run business more
effectively. Generative AI can “learn from existing artifacts to generate new, realistic artifacts
that reflect the characteristics of the training data but don&#39;t repeat it.”
Using ai to analyze new ways to produce/deliver products will allow companies to get accurate
predictions and cut costs. Generative AI is currently used to answer common customer questions.
The data collected from the number of questions asked and the repetition of questions will allow
businesses to address hard points.
Generative AI can allow employees assistance with things like generating product/system
designs, and exploring data in new and innovative ways that allow for new solutions. AI allows
for repetitive tasks to be done in moments, allowing employees the ability to focus on more
complicated work.

Overall, Generative AI should take a load off of daily employee tasks. But the innovative ways
generative ai can expand business are countless. Using past data and current trends, generative ai
will allow businesses to test new markets, cut off hard points, and build cheaper and more
efficient practices."
402,S0082,2,"Generative AI can be used in an innovative way by organizations for strategic purposes. They can use chat bots and virtual assistants to help create helpful conversations with customers or even employees. They can act as a support chat or guidance help. Generative AI can create chat bots that can do all the customer responses, book appointments, scheduling, email writing, and daily reports. Organizations can generate real designs for products and services all based on user preferences and feedback/data. AI can create a logo that will stand out for the users needs in that industry. Software and codes to perform certain tasks can be assembled. Generative AI can also create new relevant content that is real for organizations. They can use this for their personalized emails, blogs, or even ads. Data can be analyzed at large complex sets to find different patterns and insights to help with sales and strategies going forward. Generative AI can detect fraud and cyberattacks that can be harmful to organizations. This cyber security will allow the data to be safe within a business to further enhance safety. The AI can also detect malfunctions from real machinery. Generative AI can tell one exactly when a machine need repaired or replaced. This can save organizations a lot of money, in turn creating a more successful business from the inside and out. 
"
403,S0083,2,"From reading these subreddits, there are many ways AI can help with innovation is a business
setting. AI has the power to have a positive effect on reducing product/service costs by having
AI engineers create programs that can make a routine process automatic which will result in
lower labor expenses. One example of that can be medical device companies using AI to
increase efficiency to help with better workflow. An enhanced customer experience can be
achieved with AI as well. AI can be developed to satisfy customer needs by helping them out
with any concerns, giving answers, and directing them to who to talk to. Having AI to help out
with customers can increase their labor costs this way too. As for employee productivity, if the
person knows how to use AI to their advantage in a workplace then their productivity would
increase. For example, an artist can use AI to enhance and improve their art work and that
would help with the artist’s efficiency. The turnover rate for these companies that use AI will
have a positive effect on business overall.
One main concern from the public is that their jobs will be useless if AI takes over and that AI
will ultimately take over jobs. In my opinion, I believe that companies are still going to need
humans to work for them. AI is evolving quickly but not enough for everyone to be replaced. I do
believe that in the far future, AI might be more convenient for businesses to have but there are
many things that humans can do but AI cant."
404,S0084,2,"Generative AI can absolutely be used in an innovative way by organizations and it already is.
When an organization aims to reduce their costs, improve customer service, improve employee
productivity, etc. a large portion of their time is spent on coming up with the ideas and then
implementing them into their organizations. Generative AI significantly automates this process,
saving these organizations a ton of time. Instead of allocating resources to a team that can come
up with these ideas, organizations can use generative AI to get the same result without the use of
the resources.
A great example of where generative AI has been used for the strategic purposes mentioned
above is in the e-commerce space. A generative AI can create mockups, social media posts,
product descriptions, etc… without the need of a user manually creating them. Chatbots fall
under the same realm. Chatbots can utilize generative AI to provide their customers with an
instantaneous response at any point in the day. There is no need for an organization to hire
manual labor when the AI can be more effective for free. From what I have seen, youtubers and
content creators are capitalizing on generative AIs ability in order for them to continue to build
their businesses. Instead of hiring thumbnail creators, youtubers are looking to use AI to generate
their thumbnails. Some individuals have even found a niche in faceless youtube videos where
they can use an AI generated voice with an AI generated script. They are still putting out and

creating content at a much cheaper cost and in a much more time efficient manner. Another
example is with music platforms like Spotify. Spotify uses generative AI in order to create
personal music recommendations based on the data it has collected from its user. This is how it is
able to suggest music that is similar to the music that a user would usually listen to."
405,S0085,2,"From the multiple previous responses from the community I have joined, I believe that generative
AI can be used in an innovative way within a work environment. One way that generative AI can be used
is by helping to reduce costs within an organization. Generative AI is able to take a concept or idea and
produce the wanted outcome. Compared to humans doing such tasks, the generative AI completes them in
a more timely manner and cost efficient way that humans just aren’t able to. Another way that generative
AI can be used in an innovative way is through customer service. For most companies, they don’t have
humans working in customer services at all hours of the day. This is where some companies have started
using chatbots. Chatbots have been able to increase customer satisfaction as it works 24/7 and customers
are able to ask questions at any time they need to. Generative AI can also be used to enhance productivity
by using their AI-generated reports. AI-generative reports can inform an organization on their
modeling-results and insights. By utilizing this aspect of AI, organizations are able to get an accurate
picture of how their organization is doing, which they are then able to make adjustments when and where
they are needed."
406,S0086,2,"Emerging technologies offer strategic advantages to organizations if they are used correctly and
ethically. Generative AI, in particular, has found widespread application across diverse industries,
enhancing productivity and reducing or even cutting off some expenses.
Its content generation capabilities, spanning product descriptions, marketing copy, reports, email
marketing, daily email correspondence, website content creation, and blog writing, exemplify its
multifaceted utility. For instance, an e-commerce company grappling with the task of updating and
enhancing product descriptions for thousands of items in its online catalog. The traditional approach
involving manual content creation would be labor-intensive, time-consuming, and costly. However, by
harnessing the power of Generative AI, this company can significantly streamline its operations. The AI
system can autonomously generate engaging and accurate product descriptions, optimizing the content

for SEO and ensuring consistency throughout the catalog. As a result, the organization not only saves
considerable resources but also maintains a competitive edge with up-to-date, compelling product
descriptions that resonate with customers.
Banks and financial institutions are also using this technology for their benefits. Generative AI chatbots
can provide round-the-clock customer support by answering common queries and assisting with basic
problem-solving. These chatbots are trained to handle a wide range of customer interactions, which
allows them to “reserve” human agents to focus on more complex issues. For example, when I call
Chase, a chatbot can easily answer questions about my accounts balances or transaction history.
Generative AI also excels at summarizing lengthy documents, making it easier for employees to digest
and extract key information. This can enhance decision-making and save time in information-intensive
industries like legal and research. For instance, legal firms can use AI-generated summaries to quickly
review case documents and identify critical details.
Generative AI models can also predict demand patterns based on historical data and external factors,
which is super helpful for retailers. This feature allows organizations to optimize their supply chains,
reduce excess inventory, and minimize stockouts, leading to cost savings and improved customer
satisfaction.
For the software development industry, Generative AI has been disruptive. It can significantly expedite
and streamline the software development process, allowing organizations to code faster and more
efficiently using capabilities like code generation, auto-completion, bug detection and fixing, code
refactoring, translation and review, or predictive and collaborative coding which allows them to focus on
innovation and problem-solving.
One of the most important uses of Generative AI is in the healthcare industry, from improving patient
care to advancing medical research and streamlining administrative processes. Generative AI can create
synthetic medical images that mimic real-world conditions. The Molecule Generation model can
propose novel chemical compounds for drug development, potentially expediting the discovery of new
treatments and medications. Learning from patient data, including medical history, genetic information,
and current health status, Generative AI can diagnose a medical issue, generate personalized treatment
plans and medication recommendations. AI can also streamline administrative tasks, such as processing
insurance claims and managing billing, reducing administrative overhead and errors.
I can also mention my personal professional experience with Generative AI, which has spanned various
stages of my career. During my Computer Science Bachelor's Degree, I delved into AI and machine
learning for my thesis. I developed a script algorithm using Java to create efficient class schedules based
on factors like classroom availability, professor availability, and time slots for my university at the time.
This experience allowed me to explore the potential of AI-driven optimization. Fast forward to my

current job here in the United States, I am involved in building a platform that leverages AI and machine
learning to revolutionize the manufacturing process of concrete. Our platform goes beyond mere
automation; it aims to fully optimize concrete production. The algorithm I work on identifies and
enhances cost-efficient and environmentally friendly concrete mixtures nationwide. Moreover, we take a
holistic approach by closely monitoring carbon emissions and implementing carbon credits to ensure a
sustainable and environmentally responsible concrete production process.
Generative AI's role in different industries continues to expand as researchers and professionals explore
innovative ways to leverage AI-driven solutions for more efficient operations. However, successful
implementation requires careful planning, data quality, and ongoing human monitoring to ensure that
Generative AI aligns with organizational goals and values."
407,S0087,2,"Generative AI is being used in so many different ways to help their business in any way possible
such as to reduce product/service costs, improve customer service, and overall help their
companies thrive using the least amount of hands-on activity. The use of generative AI can make
their jobs easier by allowing the machines to do the work for them or integrate generative AI into
their own work. An example I saw about how companies are actually utilizing generative AI in
their work is one person working in EdTech uses AI to score student written responses to
prompts and uses the same technology to provide feedback. Using AI to help with grading papers
cuts down the time it takes to go through hundreds of prompts, making the process more time
efficient. Another example of how industries utilize generative AI is a person who works in
radiation oncology claimed to use AI to generate and “draw” organs. The AI helps them by
identifying radiation damage on CT and MRI scans which cuts down the time it would normally
take a medical expert to do. As generative AI continues to evolve, more businesses will continue
to utilize it to make their work easier to manage."
408,S0088,2,"Generative AI offers organizations numerous innovative opportunities. One of them for example,
is generative AI in manufacturing. Utilizing generative AI for manufacturing processes can lead
to a significant reduction in the cost of products or services. An excellent example of this would
be Airbus, which uses generative design algorithms to create lightweight and cost-efficient
aircraft components. By implementing generative AI into their work, Airbus has reduced their
production costs and also started using eco-friendly practices. On top of that, generative AI can
even improve customer service by using chatbots that provide quick and accurate responses.
These responses can be curated for the customer personally. This would result in higher
customer satisfaction rates for the organizations. It can also improve employee productivity by
autonomously generating reports and content, saving valuable time, resources, and money.
Marketing departments can even benefit from AI-generated content, which would ensure
consistency and relevance of the material they are putting out. Generative AI can adapt quickly
to the quick changes in trends. This can allow organizations to come up with different and more
effective marketing strategies. Generative AI has the potential to be used in numerous innovative
ways by organizations for strategic purposes, and these are only some of them."
409,S0089,2,"Whether generative AI can being used by organizations for strategic purposes is a
question that has been pondered. As technology becomes more incorporated in our daily
lives, it has become apparent that generative AI does have the ability to work for strategic
purposes for organizations. An example of this is to improve employee productivity. This
screenshot below talks about job security vs. generative AI. From this post, I would like
to touch on how generative AI has the ability to create new job opportunities and
augment human labor, which results in increased productivity. This technology has the
ability to redirect the responsibilities of people because generative AI will be able to take
over the simpler tasks. This allows the employees to focus on more complex and creative
taks, which could develop new job roles that focus on soft skills. An example I found in
the community I joined is of a busy employee who doesn’t have time to read a long
document. This individual can use generative AI to summarize the document which saves
time and boosts productivity.
Not only could generative AI boost productivity, it could also reduce product/service
cost. Although it does cost money to keep up with the maintanance of techonology, in the
long run, it has the ability to do employee jobs at a lower cost than it is to pay employees."
410,S0090,2,"o Generative AI can be beneficial to many organizations. As previously mentioned,
generative AI tracks patterns and analyzes data. This can help organizations
reduce costs and identify issues that weren’t already addressed. AI can help find
ways to change production tactics to produce more at the lowest cost. If we look
at content, generative AI can produce content easily without having to pay an

actual employee’s salary. This could reduce cost immensely by relying on AI’s
creativity. This can cause harm by discrediting and plagiarizing creators work.
This content could be provided by an employee, but it wouldn’t be produced as
fast as generative AI could. AI can also improve customer services by providing
customizations. AI can track what users buy and are interested in. This data can
then curate the perfect recommendations for users. On the other hand, AI will
decrease employee productivity. AI can process data at a faster speed than a
human, this can then become discouraging to employees. In addition, employees
could use generative AI to complete tasks for them. An example would be a
marketing organization that relies on employee’s creativity to provide new
content. It would be easy for an employee to use generative AI to create content
without doing much outside of a couple mouse clicks."
411,S0091,2,"a. I specifically focused on this one post that led to a Business insider article
discussing how OpenAI will allow companies to access generative AI tools in
workplace emails, slideshows and spreadsheets.

b. Yes, generative AI can be used in an innovative way by organizations in order to
improve their overall productivity and efficiency. The reddit post which led to the
article, considering how Microsoft is putting a considerable amount of capital
investment into AI and integrating its functionalities into their software, I feel that
AI can definitely be used for strategic purposes. Considering that Microsoft is
integrating the tools into workplace emails, slideshows and spreadsheets, I feel
that the AI can effectively generate company emails as well as presentation and
also increase the efficiency of a person that is creating a company spreadsheet.
However, with all that said, observing the comments on the reddit post, It feels as
if the public opinion of Microsoft integrating OpenAI is rather negative. Most likely
due to recent company layoffs relating to Microsoft as well as potentially having
corporate email exchanges be a repetitive loop of AI generated content."
412,S0092,2,"Yes, generative AI can indeed be utilized in innovative ways by organizations seeking to achieve
strategic objectives. Evidenced across a number of industries, generative AI offers means of
reducing costs, improving customer service, and enhancing employee productivity. In the realm of
entertainment, generative AI can foster cost-effective content creation. Video editors, for
example, can expedite their work by using AI to add special effects and generate animations. The
gaming sector stands to benefit from generative AI’s capacity to produce intricate game
environments and narratives, enriching user experiences, cutting into developmental costs, and
catalyzing faster market releases. The financial sphere also serves as a testament to generative
AI&#39;s operational enhancements. With generative AI technology, routine tasks, such as data entry
and compliance checks, can be automated. This, in tandem with AI’s ability to conduct fraud
detection, fortifies customer trust and boosts workforce productivity. Moreover, the healthcare

domain showcases how generative AI enhances service quality. By adeptly analyzing medical
imagery and gleaning insights from vast electronic health records, diagnoses are both quicker
and more accurate, enabling healthcare professionals to ensure timely and effective patient care.
Within manufacturing, AI has the potential to play a critical role in cost and quality control.
Through predictive maintenance, potential machine failures can be anticipated, ultimately
curtailing unforeseen downtimes. Quality sees a boost when AI detects defects early, resulting in
improved customer satisfaction and fewer recalls. Productivity sees a direct increase through the
automation of tasks and the optimization of robotic processes. In summation, Generative AI can
definitely be a valuable asset for organizations–across multiple sectors–aiming to improve their
operational efficiency and augment customer experiences."
413,S0093,2,"The AI Research &amp; Development Facebook group gave a lot of ideas on how there are
ways for generative AI to improve all kinds of Academic Research, Teachers/Professors, and
even marketing in business’. For example, a post by Patricia Oldham promoted a Generative AI

Workspace called Jeda.ai. It is all about how AI is able to generate social media and digital
marketing content. This is an extremely innovative way for small businesses, who may not have
the funds for a social media manager, to still be able to get their name out there without having to
take time away from doing their other daily duties. Another post that I found that is extremely
innovative is a Generative AI platform for medical imaging. An article and post shared by Junaid
Zafar is a class all about data augmentation for AI healthcare. This is amazing for those in deep
learning and Medical Imaging."
414,S0094,2,"Yes, generative AI can be used in innovative ways by organizations for strategic purposes.
According to Reddit, Generative AI helps organizations optimize their manufacturing process. AI
does this by creating different variations and simulations of manufacturing work to find the
most cost efficient solutions. An example Reddit gave was the company Airbus using AI to
design algorithms that created the best lightweight and cost efficient aircraft plans and parts.
Generative AI can save organizations a lot of time that used to take hours which could possibly
take minutes. Another example would be online automatizing chats. Discover has a good
example of this. You have questions or need to contact discover; you first contact their AI agent
with your message. If the question is a simple question that the AI can respond too it will and if
its more of a personalized or complicated question, you are then transferred to an online real
agent. This can improve employee productivity because employees aren’t loaded with a bunch
of redundant and simple questions. This also makes their customer service more productive
because it allows real agents to tackle the more important problems while the AI takes some of
the easier problems that will cost them time. This is great because they help more customers in
less time, optimizing the time they are at work."
415,S0095,2,"Although I already mentioned one example of how generative AI can be used in an organization
to create design prototypes, here's another example: improving employee productivity. This
includes generating outlines, providing sample reports, and brainstorming ideas. By using AI
assistants, it allows employees to focus on more important tasks within an organization, overall
improving efficiency. I found a Reddit post that discussed using generative AI for video creation.
With this AI program, they can enhance video quality by adjusting small details, generating AI
speech, and synchronizing mouth movements. This can be used in different ways within an
organization, such as presenting reports through videos, editing marketing content, and
improving resolutions. Generative AI can also enhance customer service by analyzing customer
data, similar to how Amazon does. They use customer data like search history, purchases, and
browsing behavior to recommend products that customers might like, increasing revenue.
Thinking about the design made by AI made me think of how there's a mention of how
generative AI is taking away people's jobs, such as interior designers or artists. But I think that
there is no way for generative AI to completely overtake humans creatively because we are the
input to the AI; we're the main source of information."
416,S0096,2,"Yes, generative AI can be used in an innovative way by organizations for strategic purposes and
they can accomplish this in several ways. An organization can utilize generative AI by reducing
product costs through automated content creation that will require less manpower and design
efforts. For example, a clothing company that produces graphic t-shirts could use generative AI
for their designs. The generative model will use existing images and data to create a new image
that could serve as the design of the t-shirt. Instead of digitally designing or physically drawing
something, generative AI could produce quality images to use on the t-shirt with less time and
effort. If the clothing company uses this strategy, it could potentially reduce costs and increase
production for more sales.
Another way that organizations can make use of generative AI is to improve customer service
through chatbots. Chatbots are automated programs that process online conversations which are
often used for customer service interactions. Customers can receive help with their concerns by
communicating with a chatbot that does all the work in much less time compared to doing it on
the phone. I like to use this feature whenever I don’t want to get on the phone with customer
service and be put on hold for hours. There are many more ways that organizations can use
generative AI to improve their operations and I think we’ll see more of this happen in the future."
417,S0097,2,"Generative AI has the capability to innovate multiple aspects of am organization’s
processes. Any organization that wishes to market itself can use Generative AI. This new
evolution in technology allows for the luxury of users to set aside tasks for the AI to do while the

users do others things. For example, I personally know of an organization, which will not be
disclosed, that uses ChatGPT to create its pamphlets to promote themselves for potential
employees in their industry. Essentially, they used Generative AI as a substitution for a real
person for specific tasks. This would help users be more productive, keeping their efforts
focused on other duties or aspects of their organization. Businesses can also use the AI to help
develop new innovations, designs, ideas, etc. For example, organizations can use Generative
AI to identify any patterns in data to see where an organization might wish to innovate or
improve. Generative AI also has the ability to create new ideas, models, and designs, which in
turn gives an organization an advantage by using them in the innovation process. Elements of
these ideas and designs may be used in final products, or the organization’s innovators will be
able to utilize the positive elements of those ideas."
418,S0098,2,"I believe the biggest application of generative AI in business will be customer service and
how it evolves with the use of AI. Considering that AI can create text and speech in a
way that mimics real human conversation, the ways a business can use this are diverse. A
company can combine this generative AI with a user’s information they are already put in
and create a tailored experience that is unique to every single customer. Business
applications will be able to evolve past drop down menus and be able to offer full fledge
conversations to customers. A customer can ask more detailed and specific questions to
the AI and get response that is just as detailed. This format will only get better overtime
as well because as the AI has more and more interactions with customers it will build on

itself and become even more precise. This changes the entire customer experience at a
given company. Interactions will feel more fluid as if you are speaking to an actual
human being. For businesses this is only one aspect of what generative AI has to offer. AI
can be used to create code and expedite business operations. The simplification that
comes with the innovation of generative AI is going to be something we have never seen
before."
419,S0099,2,"Based on my experience in the insurance industry, there is a substantial demand for Generative
AI. In fact, we have been utilizing AI tools for a considerable period via our customer
relationship management (CRM) systems. However, the specific Generative AI I&#39;d like to discuss
presently pertains to our ongoing training efforts within our telematics application.
We are currently enrolling drivers in a program where they download the Telematics
application, which tracks various aspects of their driving habits. These tracked habits include
speed, hard braking, the times when customers tend to drive the most, and instances of

distracted driving. All this data is subsequently transmitted back to our company, where it is
employed in training our Generative AI system. This system holds the potential to significantly
enhance the accuracy of underwriting insurance policies in the future.
The advantages for the insurance company are twofold. First, it enables them to determine the
appropriate premium for each risk profile, thereby increasing profitability. Second, this increase
in profitability benefits the customers as well, as the insurance company can then maintain
more competitive rates while remaining financially viable."
420,S0100,2,"I asked ChatGPT this question to understand what AI thinks it does when it comes to strategic
purposes and what examples it thinks of. I was given a very lengthy answer with seven different
areas and an example and explanation of each area. The areas I was given are cost reduction,
improved customer service, employee productivity enhancement, innovation and product
development, supply chain optimization, quality control, and security and fraud detection. Within
all these areas ChatGPT says AI is used as a tool to help business and their employees. By
providing AI with patterns, it can detect when problems will arise or help customers by
providing answers quickly without being on hold waiting for the next available person. AI can
predict when equipment will break or when supply chains will fall short. Chatbots on websites
from banks and online shopping websites can answer quickly allow for the phone lines to be less
congested and allow for people with serious problems to quickly get off hold. This leads to
allowing businesses to always stay ahead and to allow for better customer service and ultimately
less workload for employees. With less workload asked of employees, they can be more
productive and efficient in their work."

423,S0103,2,"Yes AI can be used for many purposes by businesses for content marketing, automated reports, customer service. For instance, businesses can optimize customer service through AI by having Chatbots to provide 24/7 access to answer any questions or concerns that consumers have. It can also assist in prototypes to iterate and refine product concepts. At the workplace, AI can assist in training, in creating stimulations and training materials to use, boosting learning programs. There are many benefits of using AI as in for recommending materials manufacturing strategies to reduce costs and keeping up to date with trends. Generative AI can aid in decision-making and problem-solving by gathering datasets from the internet. It also saves time and money for companies by providing consistent data and summarize lengthy archives which makes it less demanding for employees to extract key information. But with careful analyzing of possible ethical and privacy considerations of consumers who input their data through chatbots. "
424,S0104,2,"It will be argued by many that generative AI could be used in innovative ways for a multiplicity of reasons, other would say no good would come from utilizing AI for such tasks; I will go into some examples of both sides. For example, some say that the use of AI would boost productivity, as it would streamline smaller, time-consuming tasks, whereas others believe it would make people more reliant on AI, and therefore, encourage slacking. It was said that customer service issues can be handled more effectively, without much human interaction, by answering basics, reoccurring questions and tailoring feedback for every individual. It is also said that AI can be an important analysis tool in fields such as healthcare, finance, and language! Opinions on cost vary tremendously, however. A mix between higher initial cost for longer-run savings versus saving on higher cost investments now and budgeting through more organic, traditional processes viewpoints are seen. This may mean, for example, some may think investing in machines that cut out warehouse workers who handle the forklift out now would save them money in the long term, even if each machine costs thousands right now. Others would prefer keeping the human workforce and saving the initial investment for other business operations and budgeting salaries out over the longer, broader picture.  "
425,S0105,2,"Generative AI can be an innovative way for organizations to operate in various ways. It can help
reduce service/product cost because it can complete a task more efficiently and likely error free
compared to humans, so no materials would go to waste or be used in excess. This will help save
money and ensure the quality of product is met each and every time. I believe AI could assist
with customer service as we already have existing automated messages that could assist with any
questions or issues that customers may have. Employee productivity could also be improved
because AI will work through a system that does not throw the machinery off or allow it to be
“distracted” or “lazy”. An example of AI is self ordering kiosk that many fast food restaurants
have. These self ordering kiosks are efficient for these restaurants because it reduces the wait of
customers having to be in line and it also eliminates having multiple employees at the counter."
426,S0106,2," Generative AI can definitely be used in an innovative way by organizations for purposes
such as customer service and employee productivity. To begin, we can introduce Github
Copilot, which is an automation tool that is used to help complete code and find
solutions. It can also describe input code in English, and translate code between
languages. Copilot is also able to create entire methods and functions, and this is all due
to the implementation of the OpenAI Codex, a modified version of GPT - 3. Using deep
learning, Codex is trained on public GitHub repositories, and other source codes that are
publicly available. This technology is especially useful for programmers, and those in the
tech field. An LLM, large language model, is a deep learning algorithm that can perform
a variety of tasks. Organizations can utilize this for customer support, the use of chatbots.
LLM chatbots can provide instant responses, and greater analysis of customer questions.
The chatbots can be utilized to answer frequently asked questions, as well as analyzing
more difficult questions, and generating multiple responses to assist in the issue. Overall,
LLMs reduce waiting times for customers and increase response time, leading to an
enhanced customer experience. Google utilizes PaLM 2, as their LLM."

AI tools enhance employee productivity, optimize certain operations, and can benefit supply chains using AI-driven demand predictions. and AI is already being used in many large organizations, including Netflix and Tesla. In Netflix’s case, it uses generative AI to personalize content recommendations, which leads to higher customer engagement. As for Tesla, it employs AI for autonomous driving, which enhances both customer safety and satisfaction while optimizing costs of transportation. However, organizations must approach generative AI strategically and ethically. These companies are extremely successful, and the use of AI is only adding to that success. In time, it would not be surprising if the majority of industries throughout the world relied on AI to do a lot of the heavy lifting in these kinds of scenarios. Overall, generative Ai holds immense potential for organizations aiming to achieve strategic goals. However, proper and successful implementation largely depends on a thoughtful approach as well as a clear understanding of objectives and challenges of using it."
428,S0108,2,"Artificial intelligence can be used to aid almost anything in life. It may not be immediately apparent about how specifically it can be used until it is developed though. I’m not sure specifically how generative artificial intelligence can reduce prudct/service cost though I’m sure it can. It can likely be improved the same way that customer service can. Now that artificial intelligence can analyze text and audio calls, with all these millions of calls that have been recorded, it can be figure out what people like and don’t like, and how/what to say to make phone calls as productive as possible. It can also definitely be used to improve employee productivity. It has already been shown to take thousands of jobs from artists, journalists, and others in similar fields. The picture above describes how the artificial intelligence could help so much that it just ends up doing the whole job itself and putting the person out of work. That is not necessarily a bad thing because now it can focus on even more important things. Overall this generative artificial intelligence seems to have very apparent ways of improving business and likely has some less apparent, but super important and revolutionary ways that will transform the world soon."

432,S0112,2,"Generative AI has insane strategic potential. After all, what most companies do is create a product or provide a service – and harnessing the generative power of AI will enable companies to streamline their human efforts and allow mundane, previously cost-consuming tasks to be handled by AI. I found a specific example where a company successfully handed off 30-50% of their customer service responsibilities to ChatGPT.
For helping customers troubleshoot their cameras, the company was able to train ChatGPT on the types of user questions that meant a camera was faulty, like “x isn’t working” or “the camera isn’t working. ChatGPT could then walk through appropriate troubleshooting steps. So unlike the old school “Help” guides that just laid out a bunch of steps you had to walk through, the ChatGPT enabled help tool would only provide relevant troubleshooting steps, cutting down in time spent and frustration on useless advice from the customer.
In this scenario, generative AI greatly cuts down on the cost of having a well-trained human tech-guru tackle every single help ticket. The company can be more available to more customers around the clock with minimal expense when compared to the cost of human labor. And there’s other clear uses for generative AI, like content creation for a social media profile or creating marketing art for upcoming projects. 
"
433,S0113,2,"From this feed I have found that one of  AIs main use in the business  field is creating new and efficient solutions to problems. As many Quora users stated, generative AI can make quick work of repetitive tasks that can be seen as a waste  of human time and resources. We will see more and more customer service chat bots responding to us rather than actually people in a call center. If the answers can be given at the same speed and quality, perhaps even better, why  not automate it? Next is with predictions of trends and other things such as that. From looking over years of data a generative AI can make accurate predictions of future trends and consumer behavior in a second. Work like this would take humans quite a long time. Switching to AI would  save so much  time, money and resources in these departments. AI could also aid with the supply chain. This is often a very complicated process that requires a lot of human capital to complete. If AI could  quickly calculate how much inventory needs to be bought and how fast it's going to sell it would again save time and  money."

or remake things to appeal to more potential customers. Generative AI can help with optimizing 
and processes and finding more efficient ways to complete tasks, or it can even fast track content 
production. It can also assist with the brainstorming process, enabling employees to get a look at 
ideas or potential innovations without having to spend the time fully concepting it. The big 
overall lesson to take with Generative AI being used in organizations is that it’s basically an 
excellent time saver that enables workers to get more done, while also offloading a lot of work to

For personal and in-business opportunities, generative AI can be a game-changer with how it allows you to come up with solutions efficiently and effectively to the wants and needs of your company’s goals. A person within the community on reddit that I joined had explained how when they started using generative AI for their projects that didn’t fully need that human interpretation, it allowed for more time for their larger projects. Even with ideas as simple as drafting ideas for what you are working on, generative AI is becoming essential and more than beneficial to easing the workload on what you have to accomplish. A great example I saw was using AI to draft learning and training memos. As time goes on, generative AI will only continue to expand, making the process even easier and even more reliable. For the factor of customer satisfaction, the idea of using generative AI for smaller projects will allow for more time in other projects where the work being done is necessary, overall giving you more time to work on the aspects within the company that can satisfy the consumers to your business. The almost effortless design of generative AI allows for instant results that an employee can productively read through, revise, and move on with and will lead to the most efficient results available."
437,S0117,2,Generative AI can assist in the same way robotics are used in manufacturing. Repetitive tasks that consume employee time can be reduced through the use of Generative AI. The AI can be used like a Frequently Asked Questions page on a website so that easy to fix problems can be handled by the AI as opposed to human agents who can work on the questions not on the FAQ. Generative AI can also be used in the marketing sector as you would feed it consumer data and it would output marketing that would appeal to the consumer. The AI can also be used to prototype new products and create other content. On the same vein as the marketing output you could use the generative AI to make predictions based on data fed into the AI. The AI could also optimize supply chain and quality assurance of existing products to prevent recalls or other costly errors. All of these methods can be used by generative AI to aid organizations in reducing cost or refining existing procedures to make them more efficient to increase profits.
438,S0118,2,"Generative AI can be used by organizations in innovative ways for various purposes including cost reduction, improved customer service enhanced employee productivity and more.

Or AI can be used to answer tough legal questions in an instant or help an accountant automate their filing system, the possibilities are endless. I swear in a decade we will all have personal AI assistants like Tony Stark in Iron Man. Although, there is one dreaded area I do not agree with the use of AI, customer service. Nothing more annoying than getting a badly programmed AI failing to understand me or not giving me the info I need, then I just getting fed up with the damn thing and trying to reach a person to speak with.

The way generative AI can help with content creation is by assisting with tasks related to it. For instance it can generate written content like social media posts that can have the best reach for the target audience. This not only relieves some stress on the content creator but it also reduces the amount of time and effort required for various tasks like coming up with new ideas for each TikTok video. Music composition is the creation of new works or pieces of music. Just like with content creation, generative AI can assist with generating music compositions or analyzing the characteristics of different musical styles. In the hip-hop industry composers may struggle to create a beat that is different from the others but also appealing to the target audience. Generative AI can help them find inspiration through analyzing various music styles that the composer can then create from the information provided. Lastly, artistic creation is simply the creation of beautiful or significant things. Just like with music composition, generative AI can help with inspiration or even generate original artwork.

Some examples would be education, transportation, personal assistance, customer service and data analysis. Companies and organizations always have a vested interest in reducing their costs, whatever that may mean: time, money, etc. One way that AI could help organizations strategically would be with education. An AI can quickly analyze submissions from a user to determine their efficacy on subjects. Furthermore, teaching people is one of the most costly aspects of business and an AI would reduce those costs as it functions as a company asset, not as an employee or contractor that has human needs. Another possible way AI can help companies is through improved transportation efficiency. One of the largest industries in the world is the shipping industry, AI is better suited to the task of recording thousands of similar data entries for shipping labels, destination points, and other important shipping information. Additionally, AI is best suited to finding short routes and time optimizations for the actual delivery trucks, as the AI will have data points on how long certain routes take vs others and will be able to quickly determine which routes are most efficient."

There are so many repetitive tasks that are typically done by humans, but can now be automated by a machine. This will help organizations save on labor expenses. Also with customer service, I think it's 50/50 on that, because chatbots that have 24/7 service tend to not have that personalized human feel. They just follow a simple script and it is often an eerie feeling to know they are just calculating what to say next. Netflix uses the AI to recommended different movies based on a customers preferences and what they watch which is super helpful because the suggestions end up usually being enjoyable. When it comes to employee productivity, I think it can help with doing mundane tasks such as scheduling or assigning tasks, etc. This way employees can focus on the real strategic and creative based tasks.

It aids in finding solutions revolving cost reduction, improving customer service, enhancing employee productivity, and other features. Generative AI can create its own content better than a human can, making it cheaper and more efficient than having liabilities working. Sometimes, manual work can be more expensive and not as efficient. This is an example of where generative AI comes into play for organizations. AI uses algorithms to generate more personalized information that is more useful for the company. This ultimately enhances user experience and services. Generative AI can help organizations optimize manufacturing processes by generating design variations and simulations to find cost-effective solutions. For instance, Airbus uses generative design algorithms to create lightweight and cost-efficient aircraft components. Also, AI is helpful for translations between languages. It is helpful on an international level because it helps humans connect and communicate. This will push companies to a more global audience. Predictive AI models also help companies with their projections. An example is an airline company that uses predictive AI models to optimize flight schedules, reduce fuel costs, and enhance operational efficiency."

458,S0138,2,"Generative AI can be used in an innovative way by organizations for strategic purposes in a wide
variety of fields. For example, generative AI can make many labor intensive jobs a lot safer. By
using automation and machine learning, employees will be less at risk doing dangerous jobs.
Mining is a key area that will see incredible benefit from generative AI. It is one of the most
dangerous jobs in the world, and even if machines do not completely replace the human work
involved in that sector, generative AI can create innovative solutions to protect people and do
things differently that will also result in greater safety. Generative AI will also reduce product
and service costs immensely because it will be able to determine the most cost-efficient solutions
to common problems. For example, many current smartphones are made out of the same
materials and metals, but generative AI can create different solutions that involve the utilization
of new materials and products. That would not only cut costs, but also lead to greater supply
chain stability and also potentially the protection of more natural resources. Generative AI can
also improve customer service and create tailored solutions for existing problems, and it can also
improve employee productivity by allowing employees to focus on the more creative
applications of their work, rather than repetitive tasks. These repetitive tasks take up a lot of time
and do not lead to an increase in productivity, so if employees can focus on other things, their
work will be a lot more fulfilling and a lot more beneficial for the organization as a whole."
459,S0139,2,"Generative AI has been very innovative in the sense that it takes human error out of the equation. There are many industries it can be used in, like mining, data management, customer service, etc. AI-powered chatbots can provide instant responses to customer’s questions, improving response times and reducing the need for human intervention. For instance, a company's website can deploy a chatbot to answer common customer queries 24/7. These AI-powered bots can also generate data to describe a product. For example, an e-commerce company can use generative AI to create product descriptions, reducing the need for manual copywriting. Not only can generative AI produce text generations, it can also produce illustrations. One thing I saw a lot on Reddit was GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks). Organizations can use GANs to generate design concepts for products, such as fashion items, furniture, or automobiles. GANs can generate a wide range of design options."
460,S0140,2,"As stated in the screenshot below, generative AI can be used in an innovative way by 
organizations to elevate their overall business success. Mukund explains that AI can assist in 
automating repetitive tasks, personalizing marketing, developing products and prototyping, 
creating content, predicting analytics, enhancing employee productivity, and optimizing supply 
chain. Automating repetitive tasks such as chatbots help companies reduce costs while still 
improving customer service efficiency. Through personalized marketing, companies can focus on 
a desired market and know how to increase revenue based on that market needs. AI can also 
assist in reducing product costs by generating a virtual design of a product before executing it. 
Content creation can also be easier with the assistance of AI but must still be checked by people 
to make sure the message is correct. Company operations can be optimized by having AI 
generate and analyze data which will assist in making time more useful and reducing costs. 
Administrative tasks can also be effective by using AI, which gives employees the opportunity to 
be more productive and efficient at their tasks. Keeping track of inventory for any organization is 
more than a full-time job, but with the assistance of AI it can be a very significant easier task, 
and most importantly it will help the company save money.  "
461,S0141,2,"2.	While looking through different businesses that have talked about incorporating AI, I noticed that a lot of businesses want to incorporate AI to do the same thing. These businesses think that AI can take over their customer service completely. There have also been a couple of job listings for businesses that want someone to monitor the AI. This means that businesses are slowly starting to incorporate AI to make things more cost effective. They can save money by not having to pay as many workers when AI can do the job of multiple workers. There has also been a lot of talk of having generative AI begin to write screenplays and just hiring someone to polish it up so that it sounds like something normal people would say. The company that I found most information about was Disney. While they want to adopt AI into their system, they want to make sure it’s there to help and not replace. But they also want to cut costs and be as effective as they can with the money that is coming into the company. "
462,S0142,2,"Generative AI can be used in many inventive ways to help organizations reduce costs, improve customer service, and boost employee productivity. For example, generative AI can be used to automate procedures, generate original ideas, and create customized experiences.
Here are several examples: 
Spend less money: By automating the design, development, and testing of products and services, businesses can save time and money. improving customer service Generative AI can be used to create virtual assistants that can answer client questions and provide round-the-clock customer assistance.
Increasing employee productivity: By automating time-consuming and repetitive tasks, generative AI can free up staff time so they can focus on more strategic and innovative tasks. Furthermore, generative AI expedites laborious or repetitive operations. tasks like programming, sending emails, or summarizing long documents. Users can ask the bot for help composing emails, essays, codes, and other things by using natural language processing to simulate human-like conversations in a chat window.  
A rapidly evolving technology, generative AI has the potential to fundamentally alter how businesses operate. Success in the future will be heavily reliant on an organization's capacity to use generative AI.
"
463,S0143,2,"Generative AI, which is like a smart computer program, can be a big help for companies in some clever ways. It can help them save money, make customers happier, and help employees work better. First, it can save money by doing some jobs that people used to do. For example, it can write stuff like product descriptions and ads, so companies don't have to pay writers. It can also answer common questions from customers, so they don't need as many people in customer service. Second, it can make customers happier by knowing what they like. It looks at what customers do and like and then suggests things they might want to buy. It can also translate languages, so companies can talk to customers from different countries easily. Lastly, it can help employees work better by doing boring tasks. It can create reports and documents automatically, so employees can spend time on more important things. It can also be like a personal teacher, helping employees learn new things and do their jobs better. But companies need to use it carefully and make sure it's doing things right. They should always keep an eye on it to make sure it's helpful and not making mistakes. So, while it's a super useful tool, it's essential to use it the right way."
464,S0144,2,"The benefits of generative artificial intelligence can be viewed in reduced product and service cost. With proper use of artificial intelligence, it can save on labor budgets within businesses and companies while increasing productivity with decreased individuals on duty. While utilizing artificial intelligence may take over the responsibilities or positions of some individuals or work positions, it also opens the door to create newer opportunities for employment positions, such as data analysists and mechanical opportunities."
465,S0145,2,"Generative AI can certainly be used in many different ways by organizations for strategic purposes. Task ranging from improved work time to improving upon papers and documentation to even making it easier for workers to find issues in their system. With the help of the machine learning subreddit I have found three ways AI can be used to help improve organizations through strategic purposes. The first is through the use of things such as Text to Slides AI. This type of implementation allows employees to create PowerPoints easier with the use of AI. A worker can put in their information they got into a prompt and then the AI does the work and creates a needly professional slide to showcase their work. The second way generative AI can be used is to document code in software or coding businesses. AI can find code that has been created and input its own documentation on what it does and what variables are used. This can save workers many hours by simply allowing them to skip the documentation stage of their job. The last method I found that can improve strategic purposes with AI is using it to help build upon current games in the gaming market. AI can be used to implement more intelligent characters in the game, as well as helping refine the environment of the game and make it look cleaner. This allows for gameplay to run smoother and gives the user a more realistic gameplay."
466,S0146,2,"Since generative AI creates new data by using older existing data, it is able to help organizations in many innovative and different ways. Generative AI operates by predicting and generating data based on trained and learned patterns. With that, this can improve customer service experience with the use of AI chat boxes and suggested content based on what you consume on social media. This can also improve employee productivity as well. Since I can automate repetitive tasks more efficiently, this can make the next processes that require human interaction much quicker."
467,S0147,2,"Yes, one area where I think generative AI can improve organizations is that it can take the sales data of the company and imply outcomes based on the trends of that data. I work in the customer service side of 2K games, where I fear my job could eventually be lost by the efficiency of AI programs. It seems like a matter of time before AI is complex enough to deal with every situation a customer could come across given that you feed it enough instructions and details on how to handle customer support. It could recognize the issue that is given and follow a set of predetermined troubleshooting steps to solve the issue. I am less scared of this prospect the longer I work here because they pride themselves on the personalization of a live agent. However, I think that there will be a point where you do not question whether they are talking to a robot or not. This will be the end of traditional outsourcing of support for many large companies. We have been dealing with terrible robot operations for the longest time but advances in AI could make it into the valuable tool that it was envisioned to be when it was first created.  "
468,S0148,2,"Generative AI can absolutely be organizations strategically! I can see a future where 
generative AI is used to automatically note down ingredients as they're used and develop a 
product's label in real time- including the packaging designs! I can also see generative AI being 
used to handle customer support jobs. As a matter of fact, I even got to interact with a bot 
running on generative AI as I was ordering my glasses. The responses were clearly not pre-
written, and it was instead trying to help me based on what it knew. It was truly fascinating! 
These chat bots would also be able to answer questions about products or prices. If a product is 
no longer being produced, it could inform the customer of that so they won't have to keep 
searching around. I do see some humans needing to be backup customer support agents if the AI 
is unable to help. However, when these agents aren't saddled with many repeat or mundane 
questions that burn them out, I see them being a lot more willing to help out. This would 
definitely increase productivity. Chat bots can also collect a lot of information that companies 
would be able to put to good use. Popularly-requested products that got taken off sale can be 
brought back, for example. I believe generative AI would also be capable of identifying places 
where corporations aren't at their best and offer solutions! This would allow them to reduce 
product size, take out machinery that's costing more money than it's creating, and reduce the 
amount of leftover stock that doesn't sell."
469,S0149,2," There are many ways that generative AI can be used in an organization for strategic
purposes. One of the most talked about ways generative AI is helping companies by
increasing productivity. For example, people who need to use coding have downloaded
AI software that allows AI to produce codes at a way higher rate than what a human
could do. AI can also be used to help teachers as well. The software can be used to grade
written reports and even give feedback to the students about what they could have done
better and things they should be doing for the next written assignment. AI can also be
used to help with recommended products. This can be used by telling customers things
that they would also like based on their previous purchases. This will help customer
growth and satisfaction as well as it creating more profit for the company. All of the
things mentioned are able to produce things like this because it has data inserted into the
system for it to analyze and come up with a conclusion and even suggest things that are
related to the common data. Anything that can help people work faster will always be a
positive for a company. That is exactly what AI is doing."

471,S0151,2," Generative AI can indeed be used for strategic purposes, all of which are addressed in the
question prompt (reduce product/service cost, improve customer service, improve employee
productivity), though they are more a support tool rather than the direct reason for those
improvements. As one user suggests, generative AI can help in the manufacturing process by
optimizing the way things are done, thus lowering operating costs and that can also entail that
employee productivity is also improved if the AI is used to optimize manual labor or streamline
work done by humans. But the optimization doesn’t necessarily have to be in the actual
processes of the business as can be seen by generative AI creating marketing content, whether
that's predicting customer behavior or market trends, that saves time and resources (in other
words, optimizing). The AI can also be used to generate cost-effective solutions, or at least
inspire designs of that criteria, thus also reducing product costs; this can be highlighted in the
example of Airbus who have used generative AI to help in the design of lightweight and
cost-efficient aircraft components. Chatbots can be used to improve customer service, usually to
address questions from customers which typically follow a certain line of questioning."
472,S0152,2,"The most known organization which AI is most useful in is customer service. Virtual assistants and chatbots are widely used and they improve customer service by answering questions in a correct and timely manner which improves customer satisfaction. Since AI researches content from various platforms, it is able to personalize a user’s experience by gathering information from other platforms. By personalizing various things such as, product recommendations or marketing messages, the user gets a better experience which may lead to customer loyalty, increasing sales. With generative AI, certain online content can be created in a more precise and faster way which can reduce costs for companies. Another way which companies can reduce costs are by generating services which are normally done by humans, this can save time and costs. AI can be used to create training guides to optimize employee skills. 

"
473,S0153,2,"There is an apparent benefit to using AI technology for organizations to become more innovative and strengthen their strategic approach. Generative AI models can be used to predict supply chain disruptions or used to source the most affordable materials in a manufacturing process. This can help the organization decrease costs while still offering the product or service to their standard without disrupting leadership or wasting resources. AI can also use customer feedback and a virtually unlimited amount of customer feedback to develop ideal customer experiences and outcomes. The model can sift through vast amounts of data and fine tune the user experience based on these data, much faster than any human or human team could ever do. The AI model can also be used to improve employee productivity. The model can prioritize tasks based on company priorities and assign tasks based on company needs in real time. The model can notify management of a need to focus on a certain initiative based on predetermined metrics and goals. If there is a need to refocus resources on a different project or focus more attention on a certain department, the model can help make these adjustments without the need for a human to determine this. "
474,S0154,2,Generative AI can be used in an innovative way by organizations. AI can think of ways to use a product or an idea in a way that nobody else may have thought of before. I think a lot of this is because AI uses data from many different avenues on the internet and with its own algorithms and systems. Since it uses so much data that maybe a human wouldn’t know how to get access to it may be able to think of an innovative way to help an organization. It could find videos or articles about how something is done in another part of the world then show you how you can implement those ideas or techniques into something of your own. For example I’ve seen videos in Japan on how there is no trash or waste out on the streets since everyone sits and eats at restaurants instead of walking with their food like they do in other places. This data would be something that AI could find and then create an innovative way for people to integrate it into their lives. It could also use the data it has access to find new materials to build a product that we may not have thought about before. With this it could be a material that is cheaper to acquire or something that would aid in how long a product would be able to last without breaking down.

Generative AI can help with health care, government jobs, and much more because of its intelligence. Generative AI can be a huge help, but there is issues as to whether or not it is okay that privacy is invaded for everyone. Another issue is the lack of human interactions as AI takes care of certain things like bedside manner, etc."
476,S0156,2,"There are certainly many ways businesses can leverage artificial intelligence to increase productivity or lighten the workload of employees. Several people on this thread described using ChatGPT to write routine emails, blog posts, and advertisements. Though most of them had to edit what the AI came up with, they agreed that it saved time to use ChatGPT. Uses in marketing probably appeared the most; generating logos, writing content for websites, and even creating scripts for commercials were all tasks that the business owners responding to the question had handed off to AI. For some businesses, having ChatGPT draft emails to clients improved response times. Generating code also came up multiple times as a way to increase productivity. Programmers responding to the post commented that though ChatGPT usually produced code that included many errors, using it was still faster than looking up examples of code on the internet. Businesses have certainly found many ways to use AI to do their work faster and more efficiently in the last 8 months. The main tips for using an AI like ChatGPT that many different people mentioned were to customize the prompts given to the AI and to edit its output to correct errors and ensure a natural tone. Most of what these small business us AI for is something that a person would have to do otherwise. In that case it is nothing incredibly innovative, although it is a new way of doing something. However, this is only the beginning of what businesses will do with ChatGPT as it continues to improve and become more widely used."

478,S0158,2,"Generative AI is a fantastic tool organizations can use for strategic purposes. It can improve a broad section of different departments like customer service and productivity. From r/ArtificalIntelligence, user u/PredictorX1 mentions how a manufacturing company, they introduced generative AI to figure out why some parts that they made were getting returned. “Measurements were made on outgoing parts, and the system was trained to predict which would be rejected by the customer. This permitted the manufacturer to focus on the things which got their parts returned” (u/PredictorX1 2023). This was really interesting to read as the AI generated a full algorithm to predict which parts were going to be returned and it allowed the company to go back to the specific parts and see what the issue was and they fixed it. Boom, less returns from customers and the company saves a lot of money on making/sending replacements and dealing with unsatisfied customers. And this was all done almost automatically, aside from uploading data and statistics to the AI software, the AI took care of everything else. That saves so much time and money within a business. In this post, user u/No-Court-6689 mentions how Computer Vision is a subset of AI that companies regularly use. Especially in the security industry, they can use smart surveillance and reduce the amount of workers necessary. If an AI can successfully watch live-view cameras and pick out incorrect activity, it can save that company a full salaried employee from sitting there and watching the cameras instead. "
479,S0159,2,"There are so many ways in which AI could be used in innovative ways by organizations for

work that would otherwise take hours to complete. In doing so, generative AI allows for users to
receive new ideas, analyze trends, and provide cutting edge service in more ways than one. One
way in which generative AI allows for innovation by organizations, is its way of allowing people
to generate work that requires many technical skills without specific technical knowledge. Forexample, DeepSquare is a generative AI program that works by simplifying job creation and
management on a high-performance computing grid. Developers arte able to focus on essential
parts of an application without having to have extensive web interface knowledge, This is also
true when implementing things for use that require coding, research experience, and other skills
that would otherwise take months to years to learn. Generative AI allows for one person to do
skills that take many people their whole careers to cultivate skills in. As laborious as coding is,
generative AI can cut the time it takes to generate those codes by many fractions. This gives so
many people the power to generate even complex codes that yield very high-level programming.
This opens these tech jobs to so many people that simply need to know how to give generative
AI directives."
480,S0160,2,"Generative AI has been used in many innovative ways by several organizations for strategic purposes. Customer service is one way that generative AI has been utilized in companies. Getting a automated response when you call customer service lines is not a new found phenomenon and has been used for a couple decades now. However, what. is new is the ability to have a wider range of dialogue with the automated system. This is due large in part to the generative AI systems having a larger data pool from which to draw response to consumer questions, as well as algorithmic improvements made on the system maintenance side of things. One user stated that in the past they would call CVS pharmacy and would speak to the automated response system to be placed in the proper hold line to reach the pharmacist in order to find out if his prescription was ready. Now when they call the automated response system can tell him if or when his prescription will be ready and even asks what prescriptions he would like to refill. This makes the pharmacy run more efficiently and gets the customer out of the queue much faster than before."
481,S0161,2,"Generative AI can certainly have its benefits in helping organizations. It can be beneficial for businesses in creating better customer service and faster efficiency. Generative AI is being advanced quickly and it would be best for businesses to adopt the idea now, instead of waiting later. Adopting this technology will allow businesses to reshape their strategies and designs. There are several areas where it can have its advantages. One of them is enhancing customer service through chatbots. Currently chatbots are being used to respond to users with answers that are generated from keywords. Therefore, a user is not able to ask specific questions. The questions can only be relevant to what the chatbot can answer. Chatbots that are powered by generative AI will be able to handle routine queries and respond to complex issues. It can also assist in revolutionizing work productivity. It helps workers reduce the amount of time they spend working on a task. One of the amazing benefits is the ability for it to do R&D in the healthcare industry.

483,S0163,2,"Generative AI can be used in an innovate way for strategic purposes by companies to make their business better. However, I do think that there is a line between using generative AI to aide a business and using it for the wrong reasons. I defiantly think there is a line between using AI as a tool in business and using it in ways that almost seem like plagiarism. I saw an example of a reddit user that would use generative AI to write scripts for their advertising jobs and change it a little bit. I think this is an example of not using generative AI in an effective way. Using AI in this way seems like there could be negative legal repercussions associated with this. Another Reddit user that is known as Falix01 posted in a ChatGPT community group pointed out that Apple is putting more money into using generative AI in their business. This user pointed out that Apple wants to introduce using AI into their apple care system. I think this is an innovative thing to do because this will aide in their business by helping their customers when they need to have their products worked on. Apple is putting money into making their own generative AI system. This would be important because this type of AI would focus solely on Apple products making it better. Overall, I do think that a generative AI can make a business more innovate but it must be used in the correct way. Generative AI can be used in the wrong way, and this isn’t good for a business. "
484,S0164,2,"To my understanding, the use of AI can be used to strategically limit the amount of work needed to be done in the customer service department over the web. With the use of AI, businesses can cut out these jobs and have people do more hands-on research and more beneficial work while the AI uses a natural language understanding (NLU) model to communicate with customers as a human would. This does have some drawbacks and can be frustrating for customers if the AI is not fully understanding what the customer is asking, but in that case, a smaller number of employees could work in the customer service department and the AI can then lend the customer service to the human to deal with. This would save businesses money and time spent working to maintain customer relationships. They can take the data AI finds from customers to address their concerns on a company wide level rather than struggling with the issues not being given to” higher ups.”"

as many people to do customer service and allow their employees to be more focused on other tasks rather than tasks that can be done by generative AI. AI can also improve productive in any 
way for anyone as they can use it to answer questions and it will do the research and come up 
with the response for you. They can use it to generate ideas, and this is good for people that need 
creative help. It can also be used to generate financial data and help analyze data as well.  "

495,S0175,2,"r/ChatGPT generally says yes, organizations can use this software to improve. However, they had many notes regarding this. 
Firstly, some organizations have already seen tremendous upside to this software. One user explained that BCG consultants productivity improved by 46% after implementing ChatGPT. Other uses say that specifically in data analysis or trend prediction, generative AI can be of great use. This would save a lot of company time and working hours, allowing companies to be able to react faster and more proactively. However, users note that implementation might be difficult for organizations, especially with ethical and legal considerations. For example, the recent WGA strike agreement made it so AI was not allowed to write studio scripts. Others say that right now it has some limited use but will need continued improvement to really be influential. 
Soon enough, ChatGPT will add file uploading, profiles, organizations and workplaces. These would be premium features for users who pay, most likely. For organizations, file upload as a feature would be immensely helpful. Instead of retyping, copy-pasting, or explaining a document, you can simply send the document to ChatGPT and it will analyze it for you. This could reduce a lot of time for employees on its own. Despite this, roughly 75% of organizations are planning to ban generative AI on work devices. The primary reason for this is privacy and data security. Uploading confidential files could serve as a potential risk for organizations. Over half of all organizations recognize that AI could increase efficiency, but do not want to risk efficiency for privacy.

501,S0181,2,"arguments.
	Generative AI has already been incorporated by organizations for strategic purposes. These purposes include reducing costs and increasing employee productivity. One example is Google’s new generative AI Tool, Product Studio. The purpose of this tool is to edit or create new backgrounds for pictures of your products. This means merchants will not have to do another photoshoot of their products to make changes to the backgrounds of photos of their products. This can be used to match websites or seasonal changes and reduces costs for merchants and users. Another example of generative AI being used within organizations was a post referring to a Business Insider article. This article states that employees with bans on the use of generative AI tools have used work arounds, such as their personal devices, to boost their productivity. It states there is a complex issue that is already happening and there is a push and pull of accepting the technology to boost productivity but a fear of employer retaliation that keeps AI use secret. A third way organizations are using generative AI have been software engineers for productivity reasons. There have been several AI Coding Assistant, such as GitHub Copilot, that make the coding process more efficient and less challenging. A majority of what I have found organizations use generative AI for has been employee productivity such as merchants, writers, and software developers.
"
502,S0182,2,"AI is fully capable of being used within a workplace environment for specific purposes. AI in itself is an extremely helpful tool that allows for jobs that would take a large amount of time and human resources to be done drastically faster, and without the need of one person having to spend time on said job. Notably, AI allows for streamlining within data entries for notably, law offices. I myself have quite a few clients that are law offices or attorney's offices, and each of these offices are filled to the brim with documentation and old papers from previous cases, as these cases are required to be kept around, no matter how old they are. By using AI, this documentation is able to be processed drastically faster by being scanned, then read through via AI, rather than having a user manually search for information related to the case or situation. Drafting is also a large part within said offices that has started to utilize programs like ChatGPT to be able to have documentation written out, without needing additional time and users to do so."
503,S0183,2,AI could definitely be used in businesses. Its uses could be used in a variety of ways that are constantly improving in so many different ways. The number one example is Chatgpt; it can be used to help write code and give intelligent responses. 
504,S0184,2,"Yes, a chatter had admitted to using ChatGPT to help with her business emails, newsletters, and even daily memos. Even using it for content creation, new businesses can use it for advertising for image creation. Need a flyer? They can create hundreds of images within seconds of being asked. Not saying all will be useful, but they can find a couple of gems in the rough. Companies can also use it to summarize lengthy documents if there is a deadline incoming. A Redditor cited that the company Airbus uses generative AI to help design the most lightweight build for their products. Simple functions can help in reducing time and pay for the decision-making process because all companies will need to do is give data about their specific product and the AI can reduce their time exponentially.

505,S0185,2,"Generative AI can certainly be used for strategic purposes in organizations. Because AI is generally used for the purposes of mimicking repetitive human behaviors, generative AI is an excellent tool for increasing efficiency. Because of how far technology has come and how many developments have been made to AI, this technology can reduce product costs. Since AI is able to produce goods more quickly and efficiently than humans in some cases, businesses are paying less costs for each of their goods. Additionally, generative AI has the capabilities of providing excellent customer service. For example, on numerous online platforms such as online shopping sites, there are AI generated “chatbots” that can assist customers when they have questions or concerns. The use of these chatbots provides cost minimization and speed along with customer satisfaction. Customers are able to have their questions answered within seconds, and the company doesn’t need to pay as many workers to assist with customer service. 
	The primary reason why generative AI has so much potential to assist organizations for strategic purposes is because there is so much information available to use to the company’s advantage. By using data analytics and statistical comparisons, AI has the power to generate what organizational techniques are effective and which ones are not. This gives the company an excellent idea of what strategies they should implement into their strategic process in order to generate the most success.

508,S0188,2,"Generative artificial intelligence can be used in an innovative way by other organizations.
It can be used as a tool to detect any patterns in order to generate reports that can be
helpful for companies. Especially since most companies already have very detailed
reports describing analytics, current predictions, and current information about
performance. Due to the wide variety of predictions and patterns that generative artificial
intelligence can create, it’s able to be really helpful in getting suggestions about different
things. It can give suggestions about improving or changing customer service tactics,
improving productivity, and even possible reports with certain changes being made. One
example could be restaurants. Restaurants have reports about both their profits, expenses
and documented reviews noting their customer service. For the sake of this example, let’s
say the business is failing. There are poor reviews about their customer service, yet the
quality of their ingredients is going up. By inputting this type of information in a platform
with generative artificial intelligence, they could give suggestions as to what they could
do despite their quality improving. Something like this doesn’t require small bits of
information, but all the details available at the time in order to give effective responses.
The platform could then respond to the owner by saying that customers miss the way
food used to be prepared with other ingredients, how expenses have been focused on the
food rather than the appearance of the restaurant, or even how the demographic and
location is changing."
509,S0189,2,"From what I have read in this community, it appears that generative AI can indeed be used by organizations in innovative ways for strategic purposes. Due to the expansive amount of content that can be created with generative AI, it is considered a versatile tool and can be applied to business strategy. Many of the cases listed in the community of companies using generative AI have to do with developing marketing strategy. With generative AI businesses can develop infographics to help develop marketing strategy as well as the marketing materials themselves, which would tie into innovating the greater business strategy. Additionally, businesses have used generative AI to generate lists of keywords and phrases that customers are interested in, allowing them to see what kind of marketing strategy they should pursue. Applied to other types of business strategy, it appears the use for generative AI is the same: creating the actual materials you are putting out to make the business strategy easier or creating materials that help you to apply your business strategy. For the first case, a business that uses generative AI to write their social media posts would be innovating their business strategy by removing the need to pay high costs for a social media manager and allowing for the allocation of those funds elsewhere. For the second case, a business that uses generative AI to collect data on customer satisfaction and create a graph to show to developers would be innovating their business strategy by making it easier for developers to see the results of their business strategy and how to execute it differently or similarly."
510,S0190,2,"Yes, generative artificial intelligence could be used in an innovative way by organizations for strategic purposes to reduce product/service cost, improve customer service, improve employee productivity, etc., Since generative AI can analyze vast amounts of customer data, it could be used to generate highly personalized marketing content for whatever demographic the organization wants to market to. Generative artificial intelligence will allow organizations target their audience more effectively, increasing conversion and reducing marketing costs by avoiding basic and old campaigns. Generative artificial intelligence can also assist in product development by creating design prototypes and by choosing the cheapest and most cost-effective materials to use for a product. And lastly, generative artificial intelligence can create content, such as reports, articles, and product descriptions. This can reduce the amount organizations spend on content creation. However, even though I see the use fullness of generative artificial intelligence, I still think the best decision makers are always going to be humans. We only must use generative artificial intelligence to make products and services cost effective and then have humans look over the material made by generative artificial intelligence and not solely depend on this technology.

This allows firms to more effectively target their customers, increasing conversion rates and lowering marketing costs by eliminating generic campaigns. "
512,S0192,2,"AI is already being used for those three reasons:
1.	Customer Service: Many companies have chatbots on their websites for instant troubleshooting. They can pretty much handle anything that can be done online. They are also using AI in their answering services, which saves money on wages for customer service employees. However, I find them kind of annoying. Most of the time, if I have a problem with something (utilities, car services, health appointments), the question I have is not one that I can easily find online. I prefer to speak to an actual human being who can understand nuanced questions.
2.	Production Costs: The assembly line is being replaced by AI technology. Robots can create products more quickly, efficiently, accurately, and all without needing to sleep or take breaks. Managers can also use generative AI to determine the best cost saving strategies. They could make accurate projections based on real data from AI, that could show them results for implementing different options.
3.	Employee Productivity: This implications of generative AI in employee productivity would vary greatly depending on the field of business. It is especially useful in creative fields. If a Shutterfly employee had an idea for a new card design, instead of taking the time to tediously draw it out, they could use generative AI to test out all their options within seconds. This can be an incredible time saver. They can focus more on innovation and idea creation while AI helps with the execution.

513,S0193,2," Generative AI is extremely versatile in its uses, making it perfect for innovation. This
technology can be used to augment human capabilities, taking strength from both human
and AI components. By using both AI and human creativity/work, businesses canenhance productivity by a large margin. For example, a company can use generative AI
in their marketing department with relative ease. A marketer or marketing team can
brainstorm ideas and use generative AI to see them in action. They can then choose
which ideas will work best and expand, all in a relatively short period. AI can of course
decrease costs as well. Mock-ups and prototypes can be pricey to create. With the use of
generative AI, ideas can be shown without those extra expenses. This technology is
already commonly used for customer service; Chatbots are featured on websites
everywhere. Many believe that AI is used for all the “heavy lifting” in a business. They
think of it as a shortcut or just an avenue for laziness. It does not have to be this way;
businesses can use this technology without relying completely on it. It works best when
used as an addition to the work already being done."

This makes the process to help customers much faster and allows them to be able to attend anyone at any time and any day thus improving their customer service. Lastly it can reduce product/service cost. Many businesses, instead of hiring a graphic designer for example to make their adds and marketing materials, they can instead use generative AI to make it for them for free.

521,S0201,2,"Generative AI is now being used by organizations to maximize profit and production with as little resources as possible. One thing about AI that makes it so helpful to these industries is its speed and accuracy. An example of this is using AI in the medical world to assist in healthcare. Some AI programs being used in the medical field include IBM Watson for Oncology, PathAI, Butterfly iQ. IBM is a program specifically used for cancer patients to determine the details of their disease and find proper treatments and clinical trials for these patients. This is revolutionary because every cancer patient is different and presents this disease in different organs, and with different strengths. While having doctors is essential and will always be important in assessing medical care, this system allows for a quicker and easier way to analyze patience and create a treatment plan that gives them the best outcome possible. PathAI is another program that uses lab work to make diagnoses from diseases that range from cancer to other non-life threatening detections. A lot of rare diseases may be hard to diagnose, or even have symptoms that present as something more common. Having these AI systems could drastically reduce human error. Butterfly iQ is another example that aims to improve the quality of ultrasounds. This allows doctors to see and diagnose things they were never able to do before. These machines are doing things humans cannot possibly do on their own, and are simply aiding the medical field into better healthcare for humans as a whole."
522,S0202,2,"By producing specialized goods and services, generative AI applications can assist businesses in remaining competitive in a market that is constantly changing. The first industry that comes to mind when mentioning Generative AI is the entertainment industry. Generative AI can be used to its utmost extent in the creation of music, video, and voice, as well as in the design of clothing and video games. You can remix current songs or create brand-new ones using techniques from Generative AI. When creating and editing videos, several AI tools are utilized to create new videos with animations and other special effects. It makes video editing easier and saves time for social media influencers and content providers. Generative AI also offers significant advantages to the gaming sector. Generative AI technologies can be used to produce new settings, characters, and interactions for Virtual Reality-based games, increasing their appeal and level of involvement.

523,S0203,2,"Generative AI can be and will be used in innovative ways to improve organizations in a
wide range of areas. With the power of generative AI, automation and idea generation can be
brought to business at levels never seen before. For example, the cost of companies offering
customer service can decrease significantly. Instead of offering a live person to walk through
technical troubles, a company can use a chatbot powered by GPT or another similar language
model. The language model would be able to quickly learn what the most popular questions and
answers are, and repeat them to customers when asked about their product or service.
Additionally, these services can continue all day everyday, even on weekends and holidays as the
chatbot would not be subject to any type of breaks or vacations that humans would be. Also,
customers could more easily attempt to receive their own customer service, by asking questions
to a chatbot instead of through the company’s chatbot. The chatbot can more efficiently search
the internet for possible answers to questions or issues with a product or service. Another
example of cost reduction can be with content creation. Between ChatGPT and DALL-E, the
tools are capable of creating the majority of the content needed for a social media post. With a
text prompt, these tools can create a graphic design for the post, as well as a caption to put nextto it on social media. In the near future it may be most efficient to have generative AI create the
rough draft of a piece of content, and then have an employee make adjustments until the content
is ready for posting."
524,S0204,2,"Yes, generative AI can be used in an innovative way by organizations for many strategic
purposes. Generative AI can improve employee productivity by summarizing a lengthy

employee lots of time. Instead of taking an hour to read through pages of text, theemployee can now understand the main parts of the document and finish reading in just a
few minutes. This gives employees more time to do other necessary work. In addition,
generative AI tools, like ChatGPT, can be a guide for employees when they draft
proposals and emails. ChatGPT gives employees a general idea of what their proposals
and emails should consist of and reduces the time they spend writing them. Generative AI
can also help reduce product and service costs. With the help of AI, it allows clothing
designers to transform their sketches into 3D visuals. This way, the designers can analyze
their sketches, notice where changes need to be made and correct them before creating a
physical sample of the item. This saves the company time and money spent during the
design process and reduces how much material goes to waste. Lastly, generative AI
improves customer service by using chatbots. Chatbots can help customers when an
employee is unavailable. Chatbots can answer questions and address concerns customers
may have. Chatbots will essentially play the same role as employees but assist customers
more quickly and conveniently."

It is an aid, not a replacement. Another user stated the competitive advantage factor generative AI provides to companies. With generative AI tools, content is produced at higher levels. Higher levels of production give a competitive advantage to organizations as levels of demand increase. Generative AI can also offer a competitive advantage by minimizing operating costs. As a sophisticated tool, generative AI can perform tasks efficiently and continuously. Mistakes cost money and so does labor. Thus, generative AI will benefit companies in a financial manner.

by analyzing historical data, and using a trained data model to reduce the organization’s waste
when making products or to discontinue unutilized services. Generative AI already has strong
implementations in the customer service sector. Organizations can utilize AI chatboxes to settle
low level customer inquiries, and it can escalate to the correct staff in the customer service
departments to help with certain inquiries. An example of this would be like going to the
T-Mobile website and interacting with their customer service chatbox. You’ll be interacting with
the chatbox before you get escalated up to a human customer service representative, and thats if
the chatbox generative AI can’t assist you alone! Lastly generative AI can improve employee
productivity. Generative AI can be used to generate marketing materials, articles, or even
analysis reports that are typically created by data analysts, and it can even be used to display
dashboards highlighting important statistics used by an employee."
528,S0208,2,"Generative AI can definitely be used to innovate in many parts of an organization whether it be through services or administration that endeavors to cut down on costs of hiring people instead. AI is simply a lot faster at processes information than a person will ever be and would only cost as much as it takes to upkeep the systems and monitoring for any potential defects. We already see this in a lot of companies that use AI for their customer service machine where people are often met with an AI that will do it’s best to answer any relevant questions that someone might have about the organization of products. Many service based companies like telecoms and delivery services can be seen with this type of AI in service today, although they are a bit limited in it’s uses. As such, AI is very limited due to it’s lack of ability to adapt to more complicated needs someone might need. They could definitely guide you in the right direction or solve the more basic problems that have been covered, but they will always be as limited to their design as they are made to be. So while these inventions can provide a great benefit, there will always still be a need for humans for more complicated tasks."

With AI this might be able to be solved entirely with no hiccups in production or management. Need customer service? Why not have your AI do it instead cheaper and more reliable, efficient, and faster than an actual living and breathing person? Need to track how good an employee is doing their job? You can easily have an AI analyze their work and run it against the standard. If its good enough great! If not, you cannot waste any more time and show them the door. Harsh but business’ need to make money and unproductive people who take up a salary or wage can hamper profitability. AI can easily make any company with the right cogs fit into place, while fitting these cogs into the correct place has been a challenge since the dawn of labor AI might be able to fix everything."
530,S0210,2,"According to the group, yes generative AI can be used in innovative ways by organizations to achieve a specific objective such as reducing service costs, improving customer service, and enhancing employee productivity. This is how and why AI works.  Automating repetitive tasks can automate data entry, invoice processing, free up employees to focus on higher level tasks that require creativity and problem-solving abilities. With personalized marketing generative AI can analyze vast amounts of customer data and tailor content to individual preferences and behaviors in marketing content. Generative AI can help in product development and prototyping by generating design, create a continuous process that guides prototype development toward optimal outcomes and suggest cost efficient materials. AI can use algorithms to learn from existing data and create new content without human interaction. This technology can be formed in content such as articles, videos, and even social media posts. Predictive AI, on the other hand, can forecast outcomes based on historical data, aiming to anticipate future events or trends. Enhancing employee productivity can help employees become more productive. This tool can assist in administrative tasks, project planning and management, research, and writing. By improving demand forecasting generative AI can improve optimized supply chain efficiency. By predicting inventory level, and efficient shopping routines. With quality assurance generative AI has automated multiple action in software testing ensuring that products meet predefined standards. Where this will reduce the likelihood of defects and costs. Generative AI can generate customized strategies for specific businesses needs that can lead to higher customer satisfaction.

A prime example is how companies like OpenAI are using generative models like GPT-3 to develop content, create conversational agents, and improve various processes."
532,S0212,2,"Generative AI can absolutely innovate industries to reduce costs and increase profits. Generative AI can take in more information in 30 seconds than a human could in a lifetime; thus, it is a walking library of whatever is relevant to that industry. For example, marketing and digital content.
One of the most significant uses of generative AI is its ability to create highly personalized content that would further drive engagement with said content. For example, marketing can be tailored to a specific person, making them more likely to buy a product; customers always respond better to content that aligns with their unique needs and preferences. This would lead to increased profits for companies that rely on marketing for better sales. Markets such as the film industry, who rely on generating traction and momentum for their movies months prior to box office release, would be revolutionized if every person had a unique movie trailer that convinced them to watch the next big movie that releases.
Another significant use would be the effortless means of production. The AI is designed to be extremely quick in response, making marketing, customer support, and content creation faster than ever thought possible. Since AI is a tool used by humans, it is also always guaranteed to be there, meaning no labor issues. But that does call into question the ethics of generative AI.

533,S0213,2,"Generative AI is used by organizations to fulfill lots of needs that the company and consumers expect. One is how manufacturers can check for bad apples with AI. This means that AI is smart enough to detect defective products and eliminate them before they reach the customer. Another one is decision making. You can make more accurate decisions based on a large dataset faster than a human can perform the computations. Next is how generative AI makes the customer happier with more streamlined experiences. Since AI can work fast, you can check into a hotel before you speak to anyone. A cool one is product designs. AI can generate images and models of what future products could look like using set parameters.
The most useful one for me is security. You can use AI to find and prevent malicious threats like malware. Since cybersecurity is a growing concern, this is one of the best ways to protect your firm’s data. For social media, AI can generate posts and content for new and potential customers on Instagram for example. For existing customers, AI can reflect what the user likes to see, and view based on user history. This means AI can personalize their experience to their tastes. Generative AI is not to replace what we do in firms but help assist us plan better and work faster.

536,S0216,2,"Generative AI can be used in an innovative way by organizations for strategic purposes because it can create design variations and ideas to find cost effective solutions to help the organization grow and succeed. After all, a lot of organizations try to find more cost effective solutions as to how they can be better. Generative AI could help with improving customer service through chat bots. A lot of people don’t like calling on the phone to find out answers because sometimes employees become unfriendly and make it very unwelcoming for people to call. With chatbots, no one has to speak with anyone other than a robot. People have to go on the company's website anyways to get a phone number to call but if the company has a chatbot available, they can just use that chatbot to get their questions answered. An example that is used with generative AI and organizations is AI-generated marketing. With this, it saves both time and money because it goes with utilizing the internet and the resources that are available. For example, if you are trying to market a jar of peanut butter, you can have AI say a script of what you wanted to say and have it being presented with the picture of peanut butter on the screen so your audience knows what you are talking about.

545,S0225,2,"I definitely think that generative AI can help with strategic purposes in organizations. Say
for example when it comes to risk scenarios in a company or organization. Because
generative AI picks up on patterns, it could help think of possible outcomes that could be
problematic in the long run. It can point out something that could potentially happen if
XYZ was done, that a human could have probably missed. I do however think that it candecrease employee productivity. Technology alone has done so much over the past years
and it has changed the way we do things normally. We use the internet and technology in
our everyday lives that it has just become a norm, and not saying that it makes us lazy,
but it does make us reliant because a question can simply be answered from a simple
google search. Especially now with generative AI, if used the wrong way it can definitely
impact employee productivity. Instead of using it as a tool, it could be abused and simply
have it do the work for us."
546,S0226,2,"From one of the Reddit questions asked, the tread had a lot of people with experience
with this. One reply spoke to improved employee productivity. The example they gave
was if you were short on time and needed to review a document. You can use an AIprogram that can summarize the information faster than you could. It will highlight all the
important points of the document for you as well. While I was reading further down the
thread there was this one account that gave a real life example of all the help that chat
GPT helped her with for their job. The list is vast for what she used it for but I will list the
main ones. It allowed her to create a proposal for what type of food drive to do for the
company, drafting up memos for employee training, how to respond to difficult emails,
helped her prepare for phone calls with models of those calls, helped her to prepare for
conversations with clients and more. Her example really touched on all aspects for the

actual products. This helps in reducing defects and maintaining product quality.  "
549,S0229,2,"AI is a tool that can help businesses innovate new ways for strategic purposes. It will not solve all business problems but help improve customer service, employee productivity, and product or service costs. One example is automated customer service tasks, such as answering FAQs and resolving simple or general issues customers may have. Doing specific tasks that AI does can free up human customer service representatives to focus on more complex tasks, which will improve customer satisfaction and retention. It can also keep up with production as employees can focus on other tasks. AI also optimizes marketing campaigns by targeting the right audience, personalizing messages, and tracking results. Some systems companies can gather information from their audience regarding their complaints or satisfaction with the product. This information can help companies or business owners improve their product development or services by identifying new opportunities, testing concepts, and optimizing designs. It can lead to the development of more innovative and successful products. By companies being able to use AI correctly, this can lead to increased sales and revenue. Now, There are certain things AI can’t do, such as replacing humans and giving out ideas for new products. AI is something that has only information that is available to them and does not think outside the box. AI is beneficial to the business organization, but one thing for sure is that it won’t solve all the issues a business has."

One way generative AI already exists in reducing service costs is with grocery store self-checkout machines. These machines are programmed to scan item barcodes and take payment like a regular transaction. Customer service can be improved with website chatbots and services to process refunds. Walmart has a customer service chat on their application where you can request an item you haven’t received or get a label to ship back an item you no longer need. To improve employee productivity generative AI can be used to process customer orders more efficiently and help employees find the items more quickly where they are located. When I worked at an Express clothing store, they had an application where you could see the items the customer ordered and where they were located in the store. This helped with a more efficient shipping process to customers and saved time for the company. Generative AI is used in different ways depending on the company, but these practices are normal now in today's society."
552,S0232,2,"I would say that Since Generative AI is used to produce new high-quality content in all forms, it is definitely an innovative way for organizations to leverage their business strategically in order to reduce product/service cost, improve customer service and productivity.
For instance, it can help with creative marketing campaigns, where everyone uses social media these days, so it can provide brand new content video, images for your company or brand to help boost sales. Overall using social media for marketing purposes is the most cost effective for many businesses, especially small businesses.
Providing generative AI chatbots on your business website will also support and increase customer service, by providing around the clock assistance using word tags, and simple questions and answers for customers without waiting to speak to a live agent.

organizations for strategic purposes."
556,S0236,2,"Through the information I learned in this subreddit, I believe that generative AI can be used in an innovative way by organizations for strategic purposes, and has a lot of potential to reduce costs and improve efficiency throughout the organization. For example, advertising agencies have begun to use AI to conduct research on competitors, develop creative campaigns, and write advertising copy, but it can also be used to strategically place advertisements so they get in front of the right audiences. In addition, organizations can use fake models to show off products. This allows for a faster, streamlined process for businesses trying to lower marketing costs, and allows them to showcase their products without having to spend time planning and photographing campaigns. AI can also find ways to reoptimize designs, improve product efficiency, and find new ways to pin point the needs of consumers without having to spend hundreds of man hours. I think that this is a huge innovative solution, and will only continue to grow as it better understands human need and desire. However, I learned through the community that there are a lot of ethical implications with generative AI, and that using these generations can impact job security and there are concerns regarding stolen content, so it can also be seen as a negative impact on future innovation.

	In production, AI can streamline manufacturing processes, reducing costs with less steps and less waste in manufacturing. AI can also better identify defects in products through learning qualities of defective products.
	In customer service, AI can learn about problems customers have and improve on the design of the product, tailoring the needs more to the users. AI can also come up with better responses to certain customer complaints, making customer service experiences smoother and more successful.
	For employee productivity, AI can analyze documents, looking for mistakes, fixing them, and also provide summaries with key information. This would greatly improve quality of work, and speed of communication between employees.
	For the finances, AI can learn very quickly the areas in which the business is wasting money, where it can trim costs, as well as where they should invest more money. There would be very little analysis by humans, combing through profit and loss resorts, and balance sheets. AI could analyze numbers in real time, and come up with real time strategy. There almost would be no use for a CEO or any management. The only management needed would be to manage the AI to make sure it is working correctly, and to act on the advice of the AI.

generative AI can assume the position of customer support. Amazon has swapped some
manned customer service representatives with generated AI thereby reducing wages cost.
Upon input from the customer, more data can be utilized to output data for future
customers too. Also, generative AI can record data on customer experiences and suggest
improvements. If multiple customers are reporting shipping issues, generative AI can
analyze the customer data and determine if the issue is a regional problem, shipper
problem etc and then suggest a resolution for the firm. While repetitive tasks can be
performed by AI, more complex roles can be saved for human labor so employee
productivity would increase. Workers would no longer have to hand pick items for
shipping if AI can automatically perform those tasks. Instead, labor hours could be
distributed more towards roles that need more time investment."
561,S0241,2,"The simplest and easiest way to answer this question is with a yes. The use of AI significantly decreases the need for thoughtful content creation, as it serves as a strong basis to begin with. This not only reduces labor costs, but also improves the quality of created content as these models are constantly learning and piecing together new patterns from the pool they are drawing from. To touch on labor costs, though, routine human jobs can and will be easily replaced, allowing for more efficient AI interactions, and human power where it is truly needed. For example, a customer service agent may be replaced with an AI that is trained to answer an extensive set of questions. This also plays into higher quality of customer service, as AI machines allow no room for human error, issues are solved quicker and with much more ease. Employee productivity may also be streamlined. Now, it does raise the concern that the potential of AI causing more issues could be at stake as there are now many online forums to chat with personnel, being able to continue to a real-life agent may still be important to many individuals, so while it does serve a tremenos purpose on a business function end, it may not be suitable for many consumers, or at least to begin with. "
562,S0242,2,"	Generative AI can definitely be used in an innovative way by organizations for strategic purposes. For example, it can improve employee productivity and help streamline a lot of daily tasks. Or, for a business, a lot of tasks can be done through AI and be automated instead of having to pay someone to do the job, which may cut the costs of business. 
There are many random AI tools that are out there that don’t contribute to an organization, and are just used for personal uses such as a Mario Level Generator. However, other AI tools, such as ChatGPT, can improve employee productivity. ChatGPT can write code in different languages depending on what you ask of it. This will improve employee productivity by giving the employee a good starting point for code instead of spending hours on how to approach a problem. For example, Bob is asked to implement a new feature for his company’s app. Bob already has a lot to do, and doesn’t have a lot of time to think of how to start implementing the app. So, Bob asks ChatGPT to write code in order to implement a new feature into his company’s app. This code gives Bob a good head start on this project, and when he is done fine tuning and adding to the code for successful implementation, he has completed the task given in a shorter amount of time rather than if he did it without AI. AI can be used for many other things, and not just code.

563,S0243,2,"Generative AI has an impossible amount of potential in the workplace due to it’s nature of competitive learning between networks and the process that is used to generate real time data. The biggest stand out could be cost reductions and improvement in employee productivity, and I plan to expand on this. Given that AI has the sort of ability to take data and become more realistic and offer better data, I believe cost reductions can be seen in the workplace. You can use this AI to automate your workplace, and paying for equipment operated by AI is a worthwhile investment that saves your money on wage, training , etc. For example, we can look at the production plant of car parts, such as Chevy or Toyota. Machines operated by AI that are constantly learning and improving would be able to learn how to build these parts, and they could excel in the speed of making these products, inadvertently creating better customer rapport as timeliness will please customers. Employee productivity can be increased by giving available generative AI software to make their work easier and more efficient. An example of this would be the use of an app like excel, but being able to upload real time data so their work would be seamlessly done, and accuracy would be increased."
564,S0244,2,"Two ways in which generative AI can accelerate an organization's growth strategy is its ability to rapidly
scan and process huge amounts of certain types of information and synthesize it. Which organizations
could use if it needs answers to questions quickly. Yes AI can be used in an innovative way with faster
product development, enhanced customer experience and improved employee productivity, but the
specifics depend on the use case. End users should be realistic about the value they are looking to achieve,
especially when using a service as is, which has major limitations. Here's an example of me asking the AI
what I could do to improve customer service for starbucks. Generative AI could also be built into company
training for individuals if they have any questions about company policy or how to proceed with a customer
It could be beneficail having ai to rate performance and help with improving a companies organization. For
productivity it can be used in a fun way if it tracks workers productivity and progress on tasks and assignments
It can help employees be better on task. Businesses can leverage generative AI to augment human
creativity and accelerate innovation by driving operational efficiency, creating engaging marketing
campaigns, detecting fraud or generating realistic virtual agents."
565,S0245,2,"This answer goes into great detail about various ways that corporations and organizations are already using generative AI for strategic purposes. The answer also talks about ways that generative AI can still be used to improve functions of organizations. For example, the answer refers to an AI being able to take notes at meetings and recognize patterns in data; this is extremely useful information that real human beings can view and decide what to do with it. Furthermore, one innovative way that generative AI could eventually be used is to replace human run call centers completely. There are already machines that answer some calls such as calls to the bank, but in the future generative AI will be able to actually communicate with the caller instead of referring them to other humans based on what their problem or what they are looking for. Another innovative way that generative AI can be used strategically is having the AI analyze data and make decisions in a non-biased way. This is something that humans are not fully able to do. For example, if a company has to fire some people based on metrics or performance, humans should be able to fire the right people, but may subconsciously consider the personality of the person they are firing or the relationship they have with them. The generative AI would decide purely based on the data, and therefore it would be more fair. "
566,S0246,2,"Generative AI is already being used or considered being used in several different ways within
organizations for strategic planning. One of the most interesting ones I learned about is using generative
AI for insurance. A customer’s information would be submitted as data and the AI would generate a
unique insurance plan for the customer based on personal data and risk of the customer. Doing this
would improve customer service as people would have more variations on rates but also benefit the
organization as they will be able to increase the price of the service since it is significantly more
personalized. Another way is by decreasing the time it takes to create software for companies. Which
would improve both employee productivity and reduce costs. One of the posts I read explained a study
done in partnership between Brown University and several universities in China where they used
“chatbots” build software. This is a task that is typically very Time-consuming and while this isn’t perfect
as the process improves this can save time and money. However, the first thing I thought of when
reading this question is using generative AI in marketing. By inputting specific data about the market, you
want to attract the AI could create more personalized advertisements. This would improve employee
productivity as they could spend less time creating the ads and instead focus on reviewing and approving
the generated advertisement. The turnaround in advertising would lead to lower costs for organizations."
567,S0247,2,"•	Generative AI could be very useful for companies to reduce business costs. Generative AI can produce synthetic data at a fraction of the cost and effort needed to get data from real customers. Currently, applications for generative AI for businesses are not readily available. From what I have read, the public version of AI, such as Chat GPT, costs upwards of $500k daily to run. This would not be good for enterprise usage. However, once innovations to AI and increased programs are made, costs may be reduced, but at the moment, more usage indicates increased costs. The tools that a company could use are endless. Tools like the ability to create metrics on consumer recorded calls would allow reduced listening time for more time on recommendations to better the department through the data gathered. This can also help with prediction on future forecasts to allocate resources where they can be better used.
Something to consider, however, is the productivity and thoughts of people whose jobs are affected by AI; some are open to the idea of AI being also used in their jobs, and services like translation can use the help of generative AI to translate a large amount of data that would take too much time for a human to do. Generative AI can be used side by side with the employee instead of against the employee as a destructive innovation that leaves people jobless; how it is implemented is critical.

"
568,S0248,2,"-Generative AI does streamline tasks like design or content creation which helps save a lot of
people time and resources. For example retail stores like a shoe store can use generative AI to
help evaluate shoe designs which then can help cut down prototype expenses. Generative AI can
also help improve productivity by redoing repetitive and less important tasks which then help
people do other tasks that are more important to the company. For example at my job we have to
put in register numbers and it always has to equal $200 every night and generative AI can input
those numbers for me every night while I do other tasks like customer service. Generative AI can
also help improve an organization’s customer service. It can provide you with a faster and more
efficient response to any type of questions someone might have in said organization. You can
also use generative AI for customer support chatbot that would be available 24 hours a day. This
chatbot would give fast responses to anyone with a question about a certain product or about the
organization in general which would lead to higher customer satisfaction. Generative AI can
accurately mimic human-like efficiency which is why it makes it great."
569,S0249,2,"The question whether generative AI can be used as an innovative tool is a good one to ask and the answer to it is yes, of course. Many organizations can use the AI tool in the manufacturing process to create different simulations and that can lead to finding the most cost-effective solution. Productivity can also be increased by focusing on other important tasks throughout the organization and having AI that can generate reports for them. A few good examples that a few users have come up with help explain this whole concept better. Airbus, a French aircraft manufacturer, uses generative AI to create design algorithms for the best possible construction for the best price. One other example is having AI create marketing campaigns such as videos, pictures, or ideas that can ultimately be productive for the organization. Waste has always been a big issue for any line of work, it can lead to higher cost which could also lead to the bottom line being affected. With the help of AI these issues can be addressed and ultimately a much healthier bottom line would be a goal that any organization would want to strive for. "
570,S0250,2,"Generative Ai can be used in an innovative way by organizations for strategic purposes. Indeed, many companies are already implementing AI as part of their business. For example, people use chatgpt to generate social media marketing prompt or to generate business email for customers or to vendors. The post attached down below illustrates the example of how people use generative ai for their business. Even though, it doesn’t specifically illustrate how they used it for their business, this is a post that can help people who wants to learn about better command they can input in order to get optimal result for whatever they needs are. One may wonder why use ai instead of writing by themselves. However, not everyone is comfortable with English which can lead to miscommunications. To avoid that from happening, people might have to hire someone or ask someone to rewrite their writings. Which will result in another expense. However, with AI, you can avoid that expense because its free. Furthermore, for Airbnb businesses it is hard for individuals to manage multiple property. Currently there is a trend where Airbnb businesses started to implement AI into their system. AI chatbot that handles simple and repetitive questions asked by the guests. AI that generates new key number for new guests, etc. This helps to cut down huge portion of labor expense and help the business owners to have more free time. "

aiming to achieve strategic goals. It benefits areas such as cost reduction, improved 
customer service, workforce efficiency, innovation, market insights, content creation, 
and quality assurance. 
In terms of cost reduction, Generative AI automates content generation, reducing the 
need for human intervention. It also aids in supply chain optimization by predicting 
demand and suggesting inventory levels. Enhanced customer service is achieved 
through personalized product recommendations and virtual assistants, saving time and 
improving customer satisfaction. 
Workforce productivity is augmented by automating tasks and assisting with content 
generation, allowing employees to focus on higher-value activities. Generative AI contributes to innovation and product development by optimizing

from predictive analytics, reducing risks and optimizing resource allocation. 
Content creation and marketing are streamlined with AI-generated content tailored to 
target audiences, increasing engagement while saving time and resources. 
Quality assurance is improved in software development through automated testing, 
saving time and enhancing software quality. 
However, ethical considerations, data privacy, and biases in AI-generated content must 
be carefully managed. Responsible development and deployment are essential. 
Effective implementation requires a skilled workforce and a clear understanding of 
specific business objectives. Generative AI's true potential is realized when used 
thoughtfully and ethically to achieve strategic goals. "
572,S0252,2,"Generative AI can certainly be used in a strategic way by organizations in order to streamline deliverables. I found that some users in the group use AI generative services such as Open AI 4.0 daily to create SMS and email campaigns for marketing purposes on a daily basis. Using AI to create those templates compared to doing them all by hand saves time, and therefore saves the company money by reducing the time to complete those tasks by tenfold. It can also be used in a customer service aspect. In one of the examples I saw on the group, a user uses Open AI to respond to customer texts, so that a live agent ready to reply is not needed. This inherently saves the company time and money as well. In terms of employee productivity, using the examples provided above, productivity can be streamlined tenfold using AI generative services. 

"
573,S0253,2,"I believe that generative AI can be used in several different businesses to improve efficiency and quality, as well as to cut costs. Implementing generative AI as part of the strategy of the business could mean new and faster ideas that can be tested and improved faster than when the traditional methods are used. Cutting costs could come in the way of needing a reduced amount of employees and could avoid money being spent on changes or improvements to a new idea or product. 

"
574,S0254,2,"Generative AI is used in organizations for innovative and strategic purposes. It is most commonly used for support teams in businesses. Many companies use chatbots to assist in taking care of simple customer needs, such as directing customers to a password-changing guide. They use this because it is available for customers 24/7, and most user-error problems can be solved through this method. Generative AI is also capable of creating designs for companies, which can reduce the cost of production. It can create designs faster and select the best ones. This also improves employee productivity, as it cuts down on the time it takes to make products. Though generative AI can do so many of the things we deem small, it is not able to do everything without learning. An article provided by a member of my OKC group states that “generative AI opens up a new era of creative skill,” referring to continuing the creativity behind AI (Clugston, 2023). Strategic skill is implemented through generative AI, and it will always need improvement and innovation. "
575,S0255,2,"I think it's only a matter of time before we see deep-fake streams being implemented in the US market. Since creating a deep-fake is always going to be cheaper than hiring talent, I think we'll see a boom in different ""agencies' 'creating these deepfaked streamers. They might not even necessarily resemble someone popular, but if they somewhat pass the ""Uncanny Valley"", they'll surely fool people into believing they are real streamers. This will drastically reduce labor costs, since instead of having a real person the agency would have to take care of, they have an automated “human-like” AI that can work nonstop, and generate ridiculous profits for them. Many people are also already speculating that the music industry is using generative AI to create songs that artists have never written/ sang. They use the thousands of vocal databases across the internet to create the voice of an artist you love, without the artist themselves singing. This isn’t limited to only big corporations. Anyone with a keen understanding of AI has the ability to recreate the voice, or the looks of whoever they choose. It is becoming a popular trend on TikTok at the moment, for random people to create songs of artists. These are not being sung by the actual musicians, but rather by the AI that has grabbed enough information from the internet, to be able to replicate their voice."
576,S0256,2,"o	Yes, organizations can use generative AI in an innovative way to do all the above. To elaborate on the customer service example, generative AI can be used as a chat bot for a company. The bot will be able to learn the types of questions that are consistently asked by customers, then formulate answers. Over time, the chat bots will be able to learn how to answer more effectively and concisely. This would help optimize response times & eliminate issues that derive from ineffective employees. The company would also be able to eliminate most of the employees that monitor the chat service; therefore, increasing the bottom line income of stockholders. Generative AI can also improve employee productivity. For example, at my current company, our email program has recently launched a generative AI program. This program can take an entire thread of emails and summarize the main points. Also, the program will then write out a template response that can be used. When you are receiving 50-100 emails per day, this exponentially increases my productivity. It helps to refresh my memory of email conversation that I would have otherwise forgot & gives me a template email to tweak and adjust. "
577,S0257,2,"Many companies find opportunities to incorporate technology into their operations. In the case of Amazon, robots that are capable of carrying large amounts of supplies and move at high speeds are being developed to increase efficiency and productivity. This comes at the risk of employment since there would be less work for human workers to accomplish. Although, this could provide the opportunity for employees to work on other tasks that the technology would fail to accomplish. The cost of this technology would affect the cost of the product provided since it would be quite expensive for companies to adopt, but in the long run, the companies responsible for the technology would be able to reduce the selling price for other companies to purchase by making the product more efficient and cheaper to produce. Once this occurs, the adaptation of generative AI within commercial businesses would allow efficient operations that would be capable of improving itself to increase all avenues of business efficiency. Companies that can afford this technology will have a major advantage against their competitors and once technology is capable of being openly available for others, it is not hard to see them taking over the scene.

578,S0258,2,"●	With generative AI, there are so many uses for it in innovating for companies to reduce product/service costs, improve customer service, and more. To start off, generative AI can significantly reduce service costs by automating content creation for companies. Instead of paying someone to reformat content and post it to different platforms, there is generative AI that can produce this content and have it posted to different platforms with a click of a button. Along with that, companies can save money on service costs by using generative AI for their SEO and customer engagement. They can generate content for their website and posts using generative AI instead of paying someone to do that. With customer service, companies can implement generative AI into chatbots to be able to generate responses instantly for customers. That way, customers do not have to wait hours for a response from a human or a generic response that doesn’t answer their question.  Banks, for example, can deploy chatbots to address common customer questions quickly. Also, companies like Netflix and Spotify use generative AI to collect what people listen to and watch to spit out recommendations that the user may want to watch. This can increase revenue for a company because they are going to enjoy using the service if they are seeing what they want to see."
579,S0259,2," Generative AI is definitely used by organizations in various innovative ways to achieve 
 strategic goals, like cost reduction, enhanced customer service, and improved 
 employee productivity. Its versatility and ability to automate tasks and generate content 
 can offer substantial advantages. Generative AI can be applied by reducing operational 
 costs. For example, in content generation, businesses can use AI to automatically 
 create product descriptions, user manuals, or marketing materials, saving time and 
 resources. Alibaba's content creation AI, which generates thousands of product 
 descriptions in seconds, is a prime example of this cost-saving application. I personally 
 also used generative AI to redesign my bridal company's website. 
 Chatbots and virtual assistants powered by generative AI enhance customer service by 
 providing quick and accurate responses. They can handle routine inquiries, troubleshoot 
 common issues, and even personalize recommendations. Domino's Facebook ordering 
 messenger and Google's Chatbase are a few examples of AI-driven customer service  solutions. Generative AI also helps employees by automating repetitive and 
 time-consuming tasks.It can generate reports, analyze data, or draft emails, allowing 
 employees to focus on more strategic and creative aspects of their work. OpenAI's 
 GPT-3, is a great example that can be used to automate content drafting, which may 
 reduce the workload on marketing and content teams. 
 Inspirational innovation is done through generative AI by generating new ideas and 
 concepts. In product design, AI-driven tools can assist in generating design variations, 
 helping organizations explore novel solutions. Autodesk's generative design software is 
 a great example, as it uses AI to optimize designs for various parameters, such as 
 weight, strength, and cost. AI-powered recommendation engines can provide highly 
 personalized experiences for customers. HBO Max is an example of a site that uses 
 generative AI to recommend movies and TV shows based on user preferences. This 
 enhances customer satisfaction. 
 While there are many benefits to AI for organizations, there are also challenges. 
 Generative AI's output may lack the understanding and context that humans provide 
 and recognize, leading to occasional inaccuracies. As a result, organizations should 
 proofread AI-generated content to ensure it aligns with their goals and expectations. 
 Organizations should also invest in data security and privacy measures to protect 
 sensitive information used by these AI systems.Generative AI offers organizations 
 powerful tools to achieve strategic objectives such as cost reduction, improved 
 customer service, and increased employee productivity. When applied thoughtfully and 
 ethically, it can be a transformative force, augmenting human capabilities and driving 
 innovation across various industries. "

In manufacturing, AI accelerates prototyping and iterative design processes, and predictive maintenance eliminates costly downtime. But responsible management is paramount, as generative AI can lead to misleading information and bias. Therefore, organizations must use it ethically and in accordance with relevant legislation to utilize its full potential."
581,S0261,2,"	I believe that generative AI can definitely be used by organizations in innovative ways to achieve strategic purposes across their operations. Some ways AI can assist organizations are through marketing, product development, and personalization. AI can automatically create content for organizations such as catch phrases, marketing campaign ideas, and it can even create music for advertisements. Additionally, businesses can gain deeper insights to their target audience as AI can create ideas for the most impactful marketing approaches. This allows organizations to allocate their resources for the best outcome. 
Additionally, generative AI can be a powerful tool when it comes to innovation; it can analyze market trends, customer feedback, and data to create new product features or ideas. It can also help in designing or prototyping new products in the most efficient way possible. 
AI is also useful when it comes to personalization to the customer experience by providing recommendations and content to individual customer preferences. This personalization can lead to an increase in customer satisfaction, engagement, and a higher sales rate, especially for online customers. 
Ultimately, generative AI can come up with ideas for marketing and product development that humans may not have thought of before, making AI a strong innovative tool for businesses.

quality assurance to ensure products that are going out are what the company wants."
583,S0263,2,"Generative AI can be used to expedite and streamline many objectives. It can be used to generate creatives for songs, pictures, movies, sounds, ideas, and plenty of other media types. This could help reduce the number of hours logged by humans doing the same work. This would cut costs in both services and product costs. One of the most common uses we see in its early development. I believe that generative AI can be very useful in customer service. Some companies use this in forms of chat bots already. Another way it is already being implemented is in some of our household objects. If you have an Amazon Alexa or Apple Home pod you currently have this technology in your house. You can use these inventions to build shopping lists, order items, generate a list of local shops or services in your area. I have personally used this to find contractors and service providers on the job. It has the ability to generate everything within a specific or nonspecific area just from the sound of your voice. This capability can be extremely helpful in increasing employee productivity in a few different ways. One way that comes to mind is using Alexa to set meetings, reminders, and generating a schedule to follow. "
584,S0264,2,"-	Generative AI can be used in innovative ways for organizations to help reduce product/service costs, improve customer service, improve employee productivity, and more. An example that generative AI can be used that applies to all these examples is the use of AI bots to handle some customer service. There are common questions and problems that may occur when using a product and the use of bots helps reduce the service cost as they do not need to pay employees to sit at a phone answering basic questions. It in some ways improves customer service as well as the answers come in immediately and there are not long wait times to get a question answered or a problem solved. This in turn helps improve employee productivity as it allows them more time to work on more complicated issues and helps solve the mass number of customer services calls that may come in. This is just one of the many various ways the generative AI can be used for strategic purposes in organizations. Another example could be when it comes to generation of design prototypes.

Mentioned in one response, there is a way to use generative AI to optimize the product and to determine the best sources of cost and other important aspects. There are ways that generative AI can improve the productivity of employees to be sure that they are giving the consumer the best experience possible. With generative AI, it is a great too to use to make sure everyone is staying on task and the job is being done effectively. It provides so many areas of growth and learning for everyone so that everything is done properly. Another response mentioned how it uses generative AI for reducing cost by using the automatic design system to test products out and stay more organized. It will save so much time and money. Also, customer service will be improved because there will be more accessible service 24/7 provided to customers. And lastly, specifically how to improve customer productivity is mainly through encouraging workers with repetitive tasks and for all to stay on track. Below shows an example of a source of generative AI and how it improved a company. 

"
586,S0266,2,"Organizations can utilize generative AI in innovative ways to strategically harness its
capabilities for various purposes. One compelling application is the reduction of product
or service costs through design optimization and simulation, mitigating the necessity
for physical prototypes. Generative AI-driven chatbots emerge as valuable assets,
enhancing response times and delivering personalized interactions in customer service.
For example, in my previous marketing job, we used chat gpt to create a response
glossary for all the reviews, messages, and customer service related issues we needed
to handle. Organizations can further improve employee productivity by employing
generative AI to automate mundane tasks, liberating human workers to concentrate on
their roles' intricate and creative dimensions. The pivotal aspect of this approach lies in
tapping into generative AI's potential to automate and reﬁne processes, thereby
catalyzing both eﬃciency and innovation. By integrating generative AI into strategic
initiatives, organizations stand to unlock multifaceted beneﬁts, from cost savings in
product development to elevated customer service experiences and streamlined
internal operations. Another example from my previous job is with graphic design. We
used an AI platform that creates videos that we can use for social media promotions.
This helped our videographer and graphic designer to ease up the load of work they had."
587,S0267,2,"AI is definitely able to be used in innovative ways by organizations and businesses.  One 
example is prototyping and development.  Many research companies such as the 
pharmaceutical, automotive and energy industries could use AI to better research what they 
need with efficiency and accuracy.  This can also allow them to work much faster and save 
money since the difficult tasks are able to be taken care of by humans.  Another easy AI could 
be used to innovate an organization is by improving customer service.  With chatbots on the 
rise, customers are able to get a response instantly and efficiently.  Their chatbot can provide 
human-like answers and understand  what the customer is asking of them.  This can save the 
company money and time by giving the customer faster responses that are automated.  This 
way, when a customer has an issue or concern that needs to be addressed, they are able to get 
a response instantly that is intelligent and recognizes the issue.  Adding on to the innovation 
side, it can also benefit employee productivity.  It is able to automate the repetitive tasks that  
 
     
 
normally would take employees a long time to do.  It can also produce reports and data, so the

588,S0268,2,"Generative AI can be used in an innovative way by an organization for strategic purposes, such
as to reduce product/service cost, improve customer service, improve employee productivity,
etc. This is due to the fact that because generative AI is so open ended, its able to be used for a
near infinite amount of tasks as long as the data and prompting from the user are thorough
enough. One example of using generative AI to improve productivity is being in the role of a
manager looking to make the most efficient schedule for employees. Let us say that this
manager had an employee call out sick at the last minute, the manager could then take the data
on hand and input it into a generative AI software that can then interpret the data and be able to
give the manager the best person available that can work the shift. Another such example is the
3D modeling industry. Gone are the days of 3D models using up precious time and energy,
when now all that is needed are pictures at various angles of the model inputted into a genitive
AI software that can then place the model in any desired location, position, etc. This can save
organizations, such as 3D warehouses, both time and money."
589,S0269,2,"Yes. generative Ai can be utilized in an innovative way by organizations in a variety of ways. In this case, I will refer to the below screenshots of a question and answer regarding how generative AI can be , and is currently being used, by real organizations.
In this case , a user answered the below question by mentioning that they use a generative AI chatbot called “Ribbo Ai”. The user also described that the bot had to be “fed” with pre-existing information from their cafeteria networking site therefore allowing it to “learn” and also “re-learning”, which allowed the user to get more accurate and more precise outputs from the chatbot by personally editing it’s answer further. Specificity and personalization are advantageous. All in all, the user described that they are satisfied with the chatbot, allowing us to draw the conclusion that it was used successfully in customer service. I have also provided a screenshot directly from the Ribbo Ai site that allows you to understand how it works in a simple graphic. It just how the user described it on their end, you provide the chatbot with information such as chats, documents, webpages, and regular text. We may very well be looking at the future of customer service!
"
590,S0270,2,"Generative AI has the potential to automate services that streamline productivity and lower costs. Additionally, AI can also improve customer service. For example, chatbots that are implemented into a customer service department lower the cost of labor to answer questions about products, and services, or guide customers through basic issues. In fact, UNLV has a chatbot named “Scarlet” to help students and faculty with issues related to email, Wi-Fi, Webcampus, and their university accounts. Even when the IT department is on vacation with the rest of the school Scarlet is there to help. Scarlet’s services are also a wait-free 24/7 service. Therefore, the AI service has made supporting students even more productive by eliminating wait times and increasing its availability 24 hours a day. AI services are not limited to customer service. Programs, like Grammarly, help employees stay productive by continuously checking literary works for spelling errors, tone, sentence structure, and vocabulary. Grammarly achieves these goals by utilizing real-time suggestions to writers instead of editing the document like a human would. Lastly, generative AI can generate more revenue for companies by personalizing the shopping experience. For example, Albertson’s grocery store utilizes an algorithm to generate personal shopping recommendations based on past purchases made on their app. Items that are frequently purchased appear at the top of the home screen and before the user checks out.

592,S0272,2,"Generative AI can definitely be used in an organizational setting in a strategic manner. The first thing that comes to mind when I think about AI in an organizational setting would be marketing. By introducing an AI to previous successful marketing schemes and advertisements it can decipher patterns to create one of its own. Diving deeper into the community people were able to give me more uses and details about using AI in an organizational setting. An example provided by another user was a study on using chat GPT with Boston Consulting Group they presented two groups of consultants with tasks. One group used no assistance from AI while the other group was AI assisted. This resulted in huge productivity margins. The group that was assisted by AI was able to complete 12.2% more tasks and completed 25.1% of tasks more quickly and were considered 40% higher quality than the group that was AI-assisted. This is a huge argument that AI does have a beneficial place in an organizational setting. However, as multiple users in the screenshot pointed out there are important things to look out for when using AI. One user provided a link where a man used AI prompts to create a company but was promptly shut down after a month. AI also raises some ethical concerns that will be covered in the next question."
593,S0273,2,"Before research, I strongly believe that generative AI is going to help organization in multiple ways. One reason for this is because you’re talking to a robot, a robot does not have emotions and their answers are not based on bias. I believe generative AI can also bring up ideas that most humans might not think about. Relating to employee productivity, one of the users in the subreddit, “u/perfect-sunrise” had a great way that generative AI could improve employee productivity. The user said, “One example: let's say you have a long document to review, but you're short on time... generative ai programs can summarize the document allowing you to be informed on the important points in minimal time.” This is a great example of how AI can help employee productivity. In regards to product service cost, I tried to ask ChatGPT questions such as, “How much would you pay for a side of fries?” As well as, “How much does Home Depot sell shovels for?” Both times, ChatGPT could not generate an answer, so I believe there is still work to do in the product/service cost regard. However, ChatGPT can give great tips on how to be a better customer service employee, so I believe it can help employees improve their skills. Overall, I am under the impression that generative AI is going to play a big factor when it comes to organization because it can give you tips and increase employee productivity. "
594,S0274,2," Generative Artificial Intelligence continues to evolve itself and has for many years
with the way it's going there will be innovative ways. Generative Artificial Intelligence can be used for
strategic purposes. Generative Artificial Intelligence can reduce product costs since it can use materials
more efficiently and can also create designs that help with logistics and production. When learning about
how Generative algorithms helped keep costs down there was a reduced part cost by 6 to 20 percent.
Another way that Generative Artificial Intelligence can be used to improve customer service is by creating
a question-and-answer system. Many websites now use Artificial Intelligence to help navigate customers
on their needs and can even get their questions answered faster by generative artificial intelligence. It can
also tell the user where to go before having to speak with a life person. Another way generative artificial
intelligence can be used is by helping employees' productivity. There are many different ways this can be
done, one of which reducing workloads, if there is a job that doesn’t require a human touch it helps
reduce the workload and increase productivity by assigning that task to a generative AI since the
employees can work on another task."

597,S0277,2,"Yes, generative AI can be used in an innovative way by organizations for strategic purposes. Generative AI will produce more innovative solutions at a much quicker speed than the average human can. For example, in the accounting industry, firms are starting to use AI to fulfil customer obligations in their advisory programs. KPMG uses AI in their advisory program to help find solutions for their clients. Adopting Generative AI indeed decreases costs and optimizes efficiency making employees more productive by decreasing a decent portion on time that they would have been spending on the job that generative AI is completing. 
However, there is a downside to this. With generative AI demonstrating its ability to work quickly and at a cheaper rate than a salary employee there is the possibility of more professionals becoming obsolete making it to where they lose their jobs. Referencing back to KPMG, as they have adopted generative AI in their advisory program, there have been multiple rounds of advisory lay-offs in the past year. However, it is not certain whether or not the layoffs were as a result of generative AI or the market being too small for the number of employees employed in the advisory program nationwide.

Generative AI can be used to create content for businesses, such as product descriptions. This helps to cut down on product/service cost because it is less expensive to use AI, than to hire someone to manually create the content the business desires. Another thing generative AI can do is function as a chatbot. Chatbots can be used for customer support issues, where a customer can talk through a messenger system to communicate their problems and have them answered almost immediately, ensuring customer satisfaction thus improving customer service. Employee productivity can be improved by using generative AI to complete repetitive tasks, for example post generation or filing, which can free up an employee to focus on more complex tasks. Another benefit to using generative AI is that they can assist with the process of developing new products and ideas. Employees can easily go through thousands of datasets and designs with generative AI, in order to compare and contrast what works well and what does not. This improves innovation and even helps to cut down on costs."

the question. It can list a series of scenarios or plans to reduce product cost, list ideas on what
can be done to improve customer service and give managers ideas on how to improve employee
productivity. This gives workers in the organization ideas that will help them successfully
improve their strategies within the organization. There is another user on Reddit who gives an
example of a prompt that they give ChatGPT to provide suggestions for a project they are
working on with details of what their goal is and what they want to avoid. This gives the team an
opportunity to try applying or gives them a foundation of ideas to create a strategy. AI gives

Using AI businesses can make predictions more efficiently and more strategically. These supply chain predictions will lead to reduced operational costs while being able to produce the right amount of the right products and cut down on the ones which need it. AI picks up trends and is able to analyze and display those for an organization to follow. 
AI can help customer service by creating personalized content. Using AI to generate ads, information, or content based on what the customer has similar interests in. This will improve customer satisfaction and engagement. Another way I can see AI helping is through virtual assistants. Think of when you login to Netflix and shows you are most interested are shown to you first. This makes you feel like it's a more personal experience and raises customer satisfaction. 
Boosting Employee productivity can also be done with AI as there are now tools to mimic hours of human work. This can be in the way of analyzing data or legal documents.

First off, I think the best way to utilize generative AI is in chatbots for websites. If the chatbot is able to learn from its own and others past experiences it can better help the customers when no real worker can get to them. This is much better than the “sorry I cannot help with this issue” chat bots we have now. It can also help with creating new models, for example if a company is creating a new wallet and all they have done so far is the 2D version or pattern, they could input that into a generative AI to get a 3D version to see how that looks. This saves on potentially creating a product that is a failure because the pattern's dimensions were offset or any other issue. Thus giving time to correct your design without having to waste resources or time. It can also be used to try and solve issues a company is having such as a manager looking on how to boost morale. Overall it is a tool that could help many companies be more efficient. "

One area for larger companies with more money to be able to throw at building generative AI is amplifying things we already have, such as think tanks, risk assessment, such as whether or not to buy a business. For more basic things, that will also cost a lot less, you can use generative AI to automate a lot of simple and mundane tasks. This is strategic because it will be able to replace jobs that you would normally have to hire someone to do, and instead of paying someone to do these tasks, you now have an AI that will do it 24/7 with no breaks. This will likely lower an organization's overhead while simultaneously increasing its productivity. Furthermore, in the future, AI can even become refined enough to be able to replace entire departments of an organization. The example given in the answer I found was AI being able to replace entire call centers.

Generative AI can be used for product and/or service cost reduction, and it can also be used for employee productivity improvement. However, Generative AI seems to not be able to be used for customer service enhancement.
Generative AI focuses on creating content that is unique and original. However, many have commented that Generative AI does not reflect or articulate things as well as a person. One user that posted on a Generative AI thread runs a business and advises other businesses to make sure they “add their own taste” to Generative Ai content, because it is easy to tell content made from a person apart from content generated by AI.
However, Generative AI can be used to cut labor costs, I speculate. It can accomplish what a whole graphic design team can do in a matter of minutes. Generative AI can also be used to enhance employee productivity. For example, if a software engineer is struggling with writing certain code for a program, Generative AI can answer questions he has about writing the code or even provide exact syntax. However, few have commented that Generative AI does not always get the larger scope of code syntax correct. In all of these respects, Generative AI has its limitations- its strengths and weaknesses.

614,S0294,2,"Generative AI can serve as a strategic asset for organizations by promptly offering innovative avenues to reduce costs, enhance customer service, and increase employee productivity. This transformative technology operates by harnessing algorithms and neural networks to generate content, solutions, and insights autonomously without any human intervention.
First, generative AI can significantly contribute to cost reduction. By automating content creation, organizations can trim labor costs while expediting processes. For instance, AI-driven chatbots can provide round-the-clock customer support, diminishing the need for human intervention. Furthermore, this technology can optimize supply chain management, allowing businesses to forecast demand accurately, manage inventory efficiently, and reduce carrying costs. The result is a leaner, cost-effective operation. An illustrative example is Walmart's use of AI to refine product replacement to ensure that the right products are stocked at the right times.
Secondly, generative AI augments customer service. AI's capacity to analyze customer data and generate personalized recommendations enhances the customer experience. A prime example of this is Amazon, which utilizes AI to provide tailored product suggestions based on individual browsing and purchasing history, thereby boosting sales and customer satisfaction. In addition, AI-powered natural language processing enables chatbots and virtual assistants to comprehend and address customer queries adeptly. IBM's Watson Assistant is also another good example based on how it provides swift and precise responses across various industries. 
In conclusion, generative AI empowers organizations to achieve strategic objectives by reducing costs, enriching customer service, and improving employee productivity.

From my conversation with the employee who worked on most of the coding, he said the service was absolutely amazing. At the time he was using GPT-4 and said it increased his productivity by 30% and made his code faster and cleaner. At that company, we also used ChatGPT to write product descriptions. The productivity of creating descriptions went up by a whopping 50%, which is a massive increase in productivity. So overall for the company they were able to increase their coding productivity by 30% and writing product descriptions went up by 50% for only the small subscription fee of 20 dollars a month that ChatGPT charges for their premium edition. Looking at bigger companies they could train a generative AI on how to respond to customer support tickets. By providing data on how customer service individuals respond to customers the AI can be trained on how it should respond to the most common requests. This decreases the overall load on the customer service employees and boosts their productivity.

Businesses will turn to generative AI because of cost reductions, enhanced productivity, and eliminating tedious tasks."
623,S0303,2,"Generative AI can indeed be used by organizations in innovative ways to achieve strategic goals and improvements in various areas, such as cost reduction, customer service enhancement and increased employee productivity. Generative AI can automate the generation of product descriptions, marketing copy, and documentation, reducing the need for human content creators. For instance, e-commerce platforms can use AI to generate product descriptions, saving time and labor costs. On the other hand, AI can predict demand and optimize inventory levels, reducing overstock and stockouts. This leads to cost savings in warehousing and transportation. Companies like Amazon use AI for demand forecasting and inventory management. Generative AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants can provide round-the-clock customer support, answer common queries, and even handle routine tasks like appointment scheduling. Examples include companies like IBM's Watson Assistant and Salesforce's Einstein Bots. AI can also analyze customer data to provide personalized product or content recommendations, enhancing the customer experience. Netflix's recommendation system is a well-known example. AI can analyze large datasets quickly and accurately, helping employees make data-driven decisions. AI can analyze market trends and customer feedback to generate innovative product ideas. For example, AI can help in the ideation phase of new product development. In industries like fashion and automotive, AI can assist in designing products or components, optimizing for factors like cost, performance, and aesthetics. Whilst generative AI offers significant potential benefits, organizations must also be mindful of ethical considerations, potential biases, and data privacy concerns. Responsible AI development and monitoring are essential to ensure that AI-driven strategies align with the organization's goals and values while maintaining transparency and fairness, which is utmost important."
624,S0304,2,"Generative AI Can be used to improve Customer Service by using Generative AI Chatbots to communicate with the customers in natural language to produce effective communication around the clock. This will improve customers because the majority of website have “FQA” Frequently asked questions which chatbots can use this information to help customers out with the easy common stuff while a customer representative can collaborate with the customer on a more subjective question or a matter that need further addressing Example the customer needs help resting their internet router but they lost the instruction they can chat with a bot and guide them through the steps and if further help is need it can learn from past experience and questionnaire on what need to happen to fix the current issue that is not described in the instruction. If the chat bot cannot resolve the issue, then it will be passed to a representative to father diagnose and fix the problem. This will help employee productivity, but also generative AI can learn from data to help business individuals make more informed decisions and overall better decisions that will have more impact on the business. Employees productivity will be increased as the generative AI can take on more task such as for marketing content creations can be a struggle for marketers at time but with generative AI it can learn from trends at the moment and produce effective and effortless content that can drive customers engagement.

625,S0305,2,"In my opinion, generative AI can help tremendously in an innovative way for organizations to reduce costs, strategize, improve customer service, cut service cost, productivity and even with employee satisfaction. Why? Due to the great technological advancement of generative AI a business can provide exceptional customer service by providing customers with high end and quality service such as voice commands and providing or prompting information that may be useful to customers. One example of a fabulous generative AI advantage that Allegiant Stadium is using is their cashierless fridges and food stands. Now we have all seen the self check out at the grocery store but this is quite different. Allegiant Stadium uses a technology that allows you to tap your card before entering the stand recognizing a form of payment followed by that you would head over to the fridge and grab your beverages and/ or snack items and then exit the stand. By the time you exit the stand it recognizes what you have taken without having to scan anything or show anyone your selections and then it charges the card for the items taken. This example gives the customer a great experience while also cutting costs and being productive.   "
626,S0306,2,"As I started my research, I was not fully aware of the difference between innovation and invention. As I communicated with others on my chosen OKC, some insight was presented by another person – innovation is applying ideas in a new and creative way, it does not need to be a brand-new invention to be innovative. I had somehow missed the difference until then.
Generative AI can be very useful in many innovative ways. I learned about how it can help with employee productivity. One of the ways I was most impressed with, that I had not considered, was use of ChatGPT to assist in the tools and commands associated with Excel. There have been so many times that I have learned about a function on Excel, but when it comes time to apply it, I cannot remember the exact details or commands that I need to use. Instead of floundering around on the program until it comes back to me, I could use ChatGPT and it will immediately tell me what I need to do. This has the potential to save a significant amount of time. 
Another innovative way many organizations use Generative AI is to have automated chatbots handle basic customer service issues. This frees up employees to do this to do things that require a human touch. However, in my opinion, this particular one is a two-edged sword. I find great frustration in getting a chatbot when what I really want is a human to step in and help me handle an issue.
"
627,S0307,2,"	Generative AI can be used by organizations innovatively to achieve strategic goals. Right now we see some examples of generative AI’s capabilities to assume repetitive, menial tasks in the workplace. In an example noted above, Microsoft has shown their generative AI model can operate as a secretary in some instances, taking detailed notes during meetings and even gathering user information from chats and cameras, and providing an analysis based to the presenter that they may not have been able to notice as they presented. Other tasks, like generating emails or other forms of writing content and automated calls are incorporating this technology to create a personalized experience for users that can provide unique experiences for customers while saving time and money for the company. In the future, we may see generative AI play an even bigger role in more crucial tasks, such as assisting doctors in diagnosing a wide variety of diseases or conditions in ways that could cut costs for customers and companies, increase the accuracy of diagnosis and treatment options, and reduce wait times and labor. However, there is a loud and clear public concern about the potential of generative AI and how it will impact the labor force across industries. It is clear that companies have an incentive to reduce their workforce to increase profits, but economic suicide could be underway if there are no measures in place to support unprecedented unemployment or significantly reduced incomes for consumers."
628,S0308,2,"Yes, theirs many ways AI can be used for strategic purposes. It can help companies in lots of ways save money. For example one positive thing is, AI can help companies automatically input a companies numbers so they don’t have to hire someone to do it. It can also help companies have a 24 hour virtual help box/conversation box that they can ask questions and get help when needed. This is a plus side for customer service! Theirs always a downside still, some customers may get frustrated and want to speak to an actual person and could find the AI to be stressful. Then theirs a chance it  can make customer satisfaction go down. The upside is employees may be happier not having to deal with basic questions from customers everyday and could make their lives a little easier. It gives customers access to the help they need right then and there.  That being said, I think AI has many innovated things to help society in many ways and increase productivity in a work place. If people allow AI into their work place it can help them succeed in many ways and help make everyone happy all organaziations, workplaces, ect. "
629,S0309,2,"When it comes to generative AI, there are many innovative ways that organizations can use for strategic purposes. This tool was essentially made for innovation, made to make the users life easier. For example, every company needs analytics to measure the profit, marketing, logistics, etc. However, not every employee is going to have a background in creating data models. The answer I received mentioned that it can be a cost and time cutting measure. Which then can lead to supply chain optimization. This would be able to measure the supply and demand of products. This would optimize which products are selling more and which products are making them lose money. Which will ultimately lead to profitability. AI would be able to generate reports and articles in a timely manner and get a good base on a topic. This ultimately saves time and money for the company. Based on an answer on Quora, they stated that one of the ways generative AI can be used is for predictive analytics, regression, classification, etc. Since this tool is used to analyze patterns and algorithms, it would be very useful and faster to produce results. This would be able to generate reports and articles in a timely manner and get a good base on a topic. 

"
630,S0310,2,"Generative AI is more than capable of being used for innovation, as mentioned previously the generative AI creates original outputs that are related to what’s being asked or what’s the subject/reason for using the AI. Some ways that AI can help for example is in reducing costs of new innovations; testing and developing is a cost that AI could diminish as it creates prototypes or tests existing innovations in order to speed the design process ultimately diminishing costs. In regard to customer service, Generative AI can be used as a full-time customer support. Its ability to use its neural, networks and discriminants to distinguish and answer customer questions with great accuracy. Touching on the subject of strategic implementations, AI is able to take an organizations current process and improve on that directly with several ideas not simply just one or a few. An example for ways AI could demonstrate employee productivity could be data entry where the AI could take whole blocks of data and sort it in the blink of an eye into the user’s preference. There is also ways that AI could create things such as invoices or estimates for a company/organization that would usually take hours or days, thus eliminating human error while creating efficiency. "
631,S0311,2,"Yes, I believe generative AI can be used in innovative ways for organizations to strategize properly. Generative AI has the potential to seek data in deeper ways than we can as humans with what we are given. We are able to point the AI in a specific direction that is based on human design and direction so it can curate results tailored to what we need. As far as customer service aspects, generative AI would be best suited to replace the need for humans when it comes to repetitive processes. AI would have the ability to give quick easy guidance to minute tasks where humans aren't needed. This will reduce most human errors on tasks that shouldn’t have any mistakes. Only when it comes to needing a human touch will AI be unable to solve the task, at least for now. AI can strategize and formulate plans to increase the productivity of their employees by maybe reorganizing the structure in which the job runs to make sure everything runs smoothly. For example, if a company wants to save money on their product cost, they can program AI to search for the best priced materials by collecting data and comparing to multiple places that offer the same materials.

633,S0313,2,"For this specific question, Mr. Bader went into specifics when it comes to how Generative AI can be used in an innovative way by organization for strategic purposes. By Mr. Bader doing that I was able to get a better understanding on how Generative AI can be really effective from a more organization perspective. Mr. Bader had basically touched on the idea that Generative AI is going to help innovate and create new ideas that may have not been possible without AI. Technically saying that organizations could use AI to help create/innovate something that they may not have thought of or have thought of but didnt know how to make it happen. He also broke it down to three separate groups of how AI could be used in an innovative way in organizations and those three groups are Automation and Efficiency, Personalization and Customization, and lastly Exploration and Inspiration. When it comes to Automation and Efficiency, I learned that AI can help with saving time and resources which is a big advantage for organizations also cause they are saving money as well and AI can generate a higher volume of content which can be beneficial to an organization. For Personalization and Customization, it could help organizations create a more personalized user interface where one could connect more on a personal level with their own personal interest within that organization. For example, a clothing line website where one can have the whole website to their own personal interest of clothing which will improve sales. Lastly, Exploration and Inspiration where AI can generate more creativity/inspiration to an organization which could help improve an employees productivity as there is a bigger picture/goal to achieve now with the newly created inspiration."
634,S0314,2,"Generative AI can be used by organizations for strategic purposes. Many different types of fields of study and organizations use AI already and as AI continues to improve, more organizations are likely to benefit from it. As the screenshots above show, engineering, and oncology are already benefiting from the usage. I find it interesting that radiation oncology uses AI to quickly find a treatment plan for patients under radiation therapy compared to a person doing it and taking a longer amount of time to do the same project. This alone shows what AI is capable of and how it can benefit companies and consumers. The same goes for the first screenshot above, it essentially does the same thing but for a different purpose. In this example, I found, that it can help with brand relationships with consumers. In this case, it helps with sales reports, questions from customers, etc. in a short time frame. One thing I found interesting was AI helping with content management because, from my previous knowledge, content management involves very human characteristics which involves psychology. After all, the content is for the public so it needs to be easily digestible. With AI becoming more common to consume in multiple places such as advertisements for many companies, it’s fascinating to see what it generates and how “human” it looks and comes off."
635,S0315,2,"The application of generative AI can alter how businesses operate by enhancing many areas of their operations. Organizations can employ generative AI in novel ways to accomplish their strategic objectives. By automating particular processes, allocating resources more effectively, or locating workflows that are more efficient, for instance, it can assist in lowering the cost of goods or services. By creating individualized suggestions or automated assistance systems, it can help enhance customer service. Additionally, by automating repetitive tasks, delivering data-driven insights, and assisting decision-making processes, generative AI can increase staff productivity. The secret is to use AI to improve efficiency, streamline processes, and provide better customer and employee experiences. Firms may employ generative AI ingeniously for a variety of strategic goals. For example automation can lower expenses, chatbots can enhance customer service, data analysis and decision assistance can increase employee productivity, and personalized content production is made easier. These applications rely on AI's capacity to handle massive datasets, produce insights, and efficiently carry out repetitive operations. In summary, AI provides a variety of ways to improve customer service, including personalizing interactions, offering proactive support. Although there are many advantages, successful deployment necessitates careful consideration of customer wants, ethical issues, and continual monitoring and improvement.

One real life example I have is a friend of mine who works in Perimeter security and IT.AI is so accurate that he can generate proposals for new security systems, as well. It’s made his day so much easier by handling the work he doesn't have time for. The beauty of AI is that you can have it correct itself if it’s wrong and once it realizes it’s wrong it won’t only update your information, but the information it recommends to every other user. It reduces cost because he doesn’t have to constantly tell an employee what he needs more than he needs to manage their schedule or payroll. Instead of hiring someone to do the work he can’t, he can manage it himself with AI.”-Cole Kintigh, Instagram follower"
637,S0317,2,"2.	Yes, generative AI can be used for strategic purposes in producing and serving in almost every type of work force. Specifically, in accounting, creating an AI that can auto do the number crunching and give us results can make work not only faster but also more efficient. Think about how much we spend on wages for employees and hours wasted on breaks. If we can create a generative AI that yes at first can be expensive, but then run on its own and can completely eliminate employees that are slower and less efficient. I got many answers saying how lives would be much easier if AI were doing work. I currently work at the Venetian and if you have an issue with the hotel the generative AI customer service tries to solve the problem. However, I see it being used for even some of the hospitality jobs. For example, generative AI that checks you into hotels and gives you deals instead of the concierge desk. AI can even replace some educational classes. The idea of having a professor that is an AI is definitely something that can appear in the upcoming future. They can answer questions and be programmed to teach the material of the class."
638,S0318,2,"Generative artificial intelligence can be used in an innovative way by organizations for strategic purposes, such as to reduce product/service cost, improve customer service, improve employee productivity, etc. For instance gen AI can utilize product/service to reduce cost by manual content creation. The AI can save time and money as the AI can gather information and data on customers to optimize the given organization so the individuals can better determine if anything regarding the customer service needs to be better altered. For example the popular retail store Nordstrom utilizes AI to personalize shopping recommendations, reducing content creation costs. Which in turn will maintain customers shopping based on the given interest of the shoppers. Many companies now utilize chat bot’s with many forms such as speaking and chat. The AI will use the data given by the developers to configure a solution for the customers. The AI is programmed to detect certain words which will in turn trigger certain responses. Some companies whom already utilize the feature are Google with Alexa, Apple with SiRi, and many other corporations. All the functions I have mentioned already improve employee productivity as the most time-consuming tasks such as customer data collection, answering general inquiries are now taken care of. Employees can better focus on more value-added work which requires the attention of a human. Some notable examples are Netflix, and Google whom utilize AI to best optimize their data system.

639,S0319,2,"Yes, Generative AI can be used by organizations for strategic purposes and can be used to reduce product/service costs, improve customer service, and improve employee productivity. Generative AI can be used to reduce product/service costs by essentially doing the job that once required a human to be able to complete. Organizations can utilize generative AI to handle customer inquiries which can provide 24/7 assistance through a chat bot. This can enable organizations to greatly save when it comes to service because now they will not require as much staff for this department. Mike, a member of ChatGPT Experts SMP also gave me examples for this such as optimizing the manufacturing processes, designing cost-effective products, and generating content for marketing. All of these examples would lead to reducing product/service costs by reducing the need for labor. Generative AI can also be used to improve customer service. The example I gave above about 24/7 chatbots for customer inquiries was for showing how they can reduce service costs, but that also can be an improvement to customer service. For example, if an organization only had customer service hours from 8-5pm before they implemented a 24/7 AI chatbot, that would be seen as an improvement. These chatbots can interact with customers, answer their questions, and resolve issues with little downtime. Lastly, Generative AI can enhance employee productivity by automating repetitive tasks, drafting emails or reports, or scenario planning. The first two are fairly simple, but can definitely lead to increased productivity, however the third I find very interesting. Scenario planning was shared to me by a Facebook group member, and it uses AI to generate potential scenarios in a business market utilizing economic indicators. This could greatly improve productivity regarding strategic decision making.

Attorneys can use gen AI to draft and proofread documents to save time and client’s money. With this more legal work can be done and cases can be solved and closed in a shorter amount of time. Along with that, AI can help law clerks and judges read through legal documents, fact check the content, and make quicker rulings thus shortening the time and expense of legal proceedings. Another example of generative AI. can be used in an innovative way by organizations for strategic purposes is the ability for AI to speed up the coding process.

Another notable concern revolves around intellectual property rights, especially when ownership of AI-generated content is ambiguous. Identifying the rightful owner of specific content becomes challenging in the realm of AI-generated materials. Ethical considerations encompass the potential for biases in the generated content, potentially leading to stereotypes or misinformation. Given that AI learns from the data it's fed, biases and harmful information present in the data could be perpetuated, posing risks to society. Transparency is key; organizations should openly acknowledge when the information is AI-generated. While generative AI holds immense promise, addressing these legal and ethical challenges is crucial for data protection, intellectual property rights, transparency, fair representation, and responsible AI use."
642,S0002,3,"There are a lot of ethical and legal dilemmas regarding generative AI in business. One of the main things is the issue with having your data & job being protected from generative AI. It is significantly important that these systems only operate with the data they need and not take data to just to have data. When your privacy is used as the foundation of AI content, it is very easy for them to break data protection regulations.   Another huge issue is the problem with AI is how it is stealing jobs from artists and actors. I already talked about the situation in which the huge company, Disney, used AI opening credits. You might have also heard about the writers strike and the actors strike that happened. The WGA fought over several months for better pay and to be protected against the works of generative AI. It is honestly so terrifying that Websites like ChatGPT are able to complete a screenplay in the matter of seconds about an imaginary character that goes by the name “Fig Frog Fredrickson the 2nd ''. Of course things won’t be the highest standard, but we are only at the starting point of generative AI. Imagine the possibilities in the years to come. It is a matter of a legal issue to make sure that AI cannot be a credited writer, can’t write “literary Material”, and cannot be source material. It doesn’t just stop at Hollywood, generative AI is also working to take the jobs of repeating tasks. For example, A copywriter wasn’t able to make the usual amount of money from jobs because companies were starting to rely on ChatGPT. It is a scary and ethically wrong situation for an generative AI to take over your job."

As told by a member of the community, much of the legal and ethical questions are answered based on the utility of the AI. They mentioned that using AI to collect data would work fine and even much to one's benefit, but generating original content would be legally debatable. One safe choice that they brought up was reading the terms and conditions of any businesses one may be working for or with and the terms and conditions of the used AI. This point confirms that one of the best ways to protect oneself legally when using AI in business matters is by reading this document that is made specifically for legal issues and security. The biggest point that the member told me was that AI should be used as a tool more than anything. According to them, centering a company around AI can be dangerous (for legal reasons) and because of that it should remain a key part of operations in a company and should be carefully used in innovation as to make sure that ideas are original and no parties are claiming false work. Finally, I was told that AI should not be a selling point of a business, as it is for many new AI companies, and should rely more on my own creativity for innovation than on the innovation that AI conveniently provides to me. All in all, it is to be used strategically as a tool."
645,S0005,3,"Generative AI has remained revolutionary and is especially useful in business settings; however, there are legal and ethical factors to consider. We are well aware of these generative AI software programs in the Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT). GPT is capable of generating useful information by extracting it from stored data and basing it on the user's input. Nonetheless, these types of generative AI sources come with their disadvantages as well. These programs are not always entirely accurate. It is possible that the software generates false information for the user. Additionally, as these programs aid in task optimization, people keep replacing them with machines. This is an ethical issue to consider because it leaves space for a larger job displacement each time, which is an example of an ethical issue regarding generative AI. When it comes to legal implications, an example is the fact that the privacy of the conversation that occurs between a user and generative AI may not be as secure as one thinks it is. Platforms claim that end-to-end encryption protects one's data, but there is always a chance for breaches and unauthorized access. Stored data is a target for vulnerabilities, which means it is not guaranteed that someone will always be the only one accessing it."

According to u/bluenotebook22, the three biggest risks include biased and false information, copyright and intellectual property issues, and data privacy violations. I believe that AI, in general, is still far too new to trust whole heartedly when making big decisions, especially within an organization. It has the potential to mislead employees with false information, as seen in the response above regarding the lawyer using a fake case. Copyright and intellectual property issues are raised due to the fact that generative AI uses real information and data when generating content. A relevant example that is currently being popularized on social media, such as TikTok, is using musical artists voice in songs that they did not personally write. This is especially misleading when there is no disclaimer attached. Data privacy violations are another key issue with generative AI. There have been instances with employees attempting to utilize generative AI at work who end up sharing private information about their company. This can include data regarding clients, financial information, and much more. Not only is this a breach of privacy for the company, but also its customers. It is best to use generative AI to generate new ideas and brainstorm as opposed to letting it take the reigns in business."
647,S0007,3,"Like with all new emerging and impactful technologies, its use has caused some serious legal and ethical issues/considerations for its use in organizational settings. What I have learned from my research through the OKC, reddit, I have found that the main risks of generative AI currently are false information, breach of copyright/intellectual property infringements, as well as privacy concerns. Although generative AI is not emotionally biased, the inputs that it learns from may be and can lead to biased media generations to users. Since generative AI takes its previous inputs to create media tailored towards humans, inherently biased inputs will lead to the generation of biased information. This can cause a variety of issues since information can be faked, skewed to mislead, and simply deceive users. Copyright
infringements and intellectual property disputes arise since generative AI seemingly creates what it thinks is original content that is best presented towards humans, and is based on available media which may be copyright protected. This can also lead to big issues since companies/individuals that are trying to make money, and students may be using generative AI to create something seemingly original, but are in fact stealing intellectual property without even knowing it, since the AI believes it is the best available information that can be generated. An example of this is the advent of students using generative AI, such as ChatGPT, to create responses to questions on assignments, which has led to academic dishonesty problems in universities and special screening on submitted items to ensure students are not cheating with generative AI. Lastly, privacy concerns regarding user data have come into question. Since the data that generative AI has access to may be personal information or even replications of real people, it can be used as a tool of deception to fake information or even statements/opinions of public individuals. Even though AI is quickly growing, it raises very serious concerns about its legal and ethical use.

Ethical and legal issues are a complex issue when it comes to AI and is hotly debated by many that are exploring the field of AI. Since AI doesn’t necessarily have the intelligence to discern what is right and wrong in a situation, some argue that it does not have the ability to assess ethics. Generative AI can also be used to exploit and spread misinformation, with a lot of new AI models that can mimic the voice of someone based on audio recordings to generate life-like recordings that can be used to trick someone - this is just one example. There are many other ways where AI is in the spotlight for ethical concerns. 
 https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/13whk5u/are_ethical_ai_dangerous_long_term/

Some also wonder how creating ‘ethical AI’ may not be the safest thing in the long-term as it could end up realizing that humans are ethically inferior and begin to resent us in the future as it grows to become more and more intelligent. These may seem far-fetched concerns out of a movie like The Terminator, but these are topics that are now being discussed seriously as it is very much a reality that AI could potentially end up beyond our control. These ethical/legal issues/concerns are contested everyday by AI developers but nonetheless it is one of the factors that are preventing AI from becoming mainstream in organizational settings.

property and the potential for it to take many jobs out of the workforce. Intellectual property is
the right for someone to have an idea first. In generative AI there is no credit given to the
original work so if something is used it could be the work of someone else. For example, I could
go on to ChatGPT and have it right me a book about a murderous clown in the style of Stephen
King and it could potentially give me the story of “It”. In other words, generative AI’s ability to
mimic a person is the real issue and questions a blurred line between what is really created by
a living person and what is created by generative AI. Another example is generative AI
mimicking singers. In the case of Drake and The Weeknd, there was a song that was 100
percent made by generative AI in the style of these two artists. However, they had no say in the

song that was created in which it took their voices and even wrote lyrics that are like songs
they already have released. Many people see this as a breach in privacy and make way for the
death of creativity. However, the OP pictured above gave it light in another way. They believe
generative AI can give a boost in creativity to those who have ideas but lack the technical skill

because many people can easily hack websites to steal your information. There is no way
to prevent a person from stealing a user’s information. This becomes a legal issue
because it involves stealing that can jeopardize someone’s life or reputation. Privacy
becomes an ethical issue because if private information is stolen then it means that a
person made a choice to do that action. While thinking or not thinking to do that action,
there are consequences because that was the wrong thing to do. One consequence could
be going to jail since as I mentioned for the legal part, it is illegal to do. An ethical option
would have been to not have done it at all. Another issue is discrimination. It is both a

legal and ethical issue. If discrimination happens, there are consequences for that.
Legally, it can also cause you to get arrested. Ethically, it just makes you look bad for
making a bad choice."
652,S0012,3,"Generative AI can go through numerous legal and ethical issues in an organizational setting.
Merely to mention the most obvious such as false information, fraud, and copyright abuses.
A lawyer suing an airline for personal injury mistakenly presented fake cases in court created by
a ChatGPT prepared by a representative in his law firm. The lawyer was accused of fraud and
irreparable damage was done to his reputation and his firm. Just as AI can rapidly create fake
cases, it may also assist with Fraud.
With the help of AI cyber attackers can produce sophisticated malware, phishing schemes, and
other fraudulent activities that could result in serious damage to individuals such as financial
losses, identity theft, and emotional attacks. Like in the case of a devasted mother who was
called by her fake daughter claiming she was kidnapped. For the same reason that AI can
imitate a voice and other data, issues regarding originality have risen and have been disputed in
court.
Businesses need to be aware of the legal risk this can encounter. Since AI systems do not
possess legal personality, they are therefore unable to have intellectual property rights. Similar

with pieces of art created by AI, it will not be protected under copyright law. There are many
other legal and ethical issues AI could bring if not used properly."
653,S0013,3,"Some legal and ethical issues associated with generative AI within an organizational setting are
due to property laws. AI can create content, raising questions about intellectual property rights.
Who actually owns this content and is it legal to make profits based on an AI’s work? AI also
tends to scour countless databases which brings the question whether the AI might pull
information that wasn’t supposed to be there. This requires companies to do their due diligence
in making sure their data isn’t accessible by bots. AI also has the capabilities to produce mass
amounts of false information based off a bogus article that was posted by a illegitimate source.
AI generated content can also be extremely deceptive as people cannot determine whether a
human created the content or not. Organizations and authors must be transparent when creating
new content. AI may also not possess human ethical reasoning, leading to inappropriate wording.
AI might also be responsible for many lost jobs due to bots being able to automate people’s jobs
and do it better. This may raise ethical concerns whether these AI can take people’s jobs without
ramification from the employer. AI must be made accountable from the people who created
them, since the legal frameworks must be attended to."
654,S0014,3,"There are transparency issues with adoption of
AI. There are also ethical concerns for employees and customers. The need to
establish the use of information collected for marketing purposes. There are also
intellectual property issues. AI is trained on a large amount of data. Impossible for
end-users to know what section of Generative AI content is protected by
copyright law or which is under which license. Companies can be involved in
lawsuits. Another issue would be job displacement. Automated tasks replace labor
for the purpose of efficiency. Transformation of an industry replaces labor."
655,S0015,3,"Generative AI in an organizational setting poses complex legal and ethical concerns. One
pressing issue concerns intellectual property, as AI-generated content raises questions

about ownership and copyright. Impartiality and judgment are equally important; AI
models can have biases from their training data, which can lead to discrimination.
Protecting privacy is of utmost importance considering the huge amounts of data that AI
often requires and the need to comply with data protection laws. AI. AI-induced errors
and non-moral liability issues are unclear, thus requiring legal clarity. Deception is
another ethical issue, since AI can mimic tasks performed by humans, and internal coding
must be transparent. The displacement of work due to automation raises ethical
challenges to workers’ well-being. Ensuring that appropriate decisions are made in AI
applications, especially in critical areas such as healthcare and finance, is essential. Data
security is a key requirement, with legal frameworks needed to protect AI models and
data processing. Finally, compliance with existing and emerging regulations is a
regulatory imperative, as non-compliance can carry consequences for organizations.
Addressing these multifaceted legal and ethical considerations is important for
organizations to mitigate risks and support both compliance and ethical integrity."
656,S0016,3,"Erza Wansyah created a news thread about the temporary suspension of AI training.
What happened was that leaders in the field such as Elon Musk and Bill Gates,
alongside thousands of other AI experts, have signed an open letter that calls for the
temporary halt of AI development.

One of the primary concerns is that generative AI is already out-pacing human
creativity, leaving us with a huge ethical question as to what human creativity is useful
for once this technology becomes even more widely adopted. As a more objective
issue, a financial analysis from Goldman Sachs has also highlighted that there are
predictions of 300 million jobs that are already able to be automated, which would result
in the greatest displacement of the workforce in human history."
657,S0017,3,"Legal and ethical issues associated with the generative AI in organizational
settings can be seen through a few different ways. The generative AI pulls information from
anywhere it can online, sometimes the information can be falsified, made up, or biased. This will
lead to the generative AI using this incorrect data to create the new data that it will give to the
person using it. This can be illegal or unethical because people in the real world have been using
the AI for research, and if the AI is producing falsified information and people use it, it leads to
many problems for that person and every one the information affected. A legal issue that the
generative AI faces is through copyrights. Since the AI pulls things that are created and known to
make new things, like videos, pictures, music, and things like voices, when it combines multiple
of them together, it sometimes does not create a completely new thing, but just a mix. This leads
to copyright infringements from artists, photographers, and other people as well. Also, there is a
lot of privacy problems. Since the AI can use someone’s voice, use people’s face through picture
or videos, people have had their privacy violated. People can use the AI to use the persons voice
and make them sing songs, say things that the real person has never said, and use videos in ways
that are very inappropriate. This leads to many problems for that person and they are also being
violated and it can ruin there life."
658,S0018,3,"In organizational settings, a legal issue could be the bounds of generative AI’s
access to organizational data. Data privacy is observed very seriously across
organizations, as data breaches could spell a recipe for financial, legal, and organizational
disaster. Now the question at hand is whether organizational data should be used to train
generative AI or not. This is due to the sensitivity of the information provided, and the
level of security Generative AI platforms have with the data they are entrusted with.
Perhaps, an answer to this question is for organizations to determine which data can be
used as generative prompts for the AI. Or to make it less complicated, like with other
existing organizations, the use of generative AI is banned to prevent such risks.

On the other hand, an ethical issue would be how could generative AI use another
person’s data input without their permission to answer other people. Again, generative AI
learns from the information it is given, and in an organizational setting, this means that
the software has the same access to organization-wide data. Even if developers could
explicitly state that data cross-contamination is impermissible, what assures the end-users
that the AI will do so? This is a whole process of implementing strict measures in the
AI’s code line such that it does not commit any sort of organizational data cross-
contamination."
659,S0019,3,"There are many different legal and ethical issues associated with generative AI in organizational
settings. However, as one Reddit user stated, “The three biggest risks involve biased and false
information, copyright and intellectual property issues, and data privacy violations”. To begin
with, when generative AI learns from biased information, they can spread false and unfair ideas,
causing legal issues. Next, copyright and intellectual property rights are an issue since generative
AI uses existing information to create something new. This can happen in the music industry.
Generative AI has the ability to mimic a singer and their style. I have seen this countless times
on the platform known as TikTok. Individuals are using AI to produce songs using the voices of
popular artists, even those who have passed away, and then share them on TikTok for everyone
to hear. Lastly, using people's faces and images without permission (also known as deep fakes) in
the entertainment industry causes legal and ethical issues and can make jobs less secure, which
can hurt the economy. As pointed out by other Reddit users, deep fakes are of great concern
since they enable malicious individuals to introduce characters into the entertainment realm that
do not age, require no compensation, and do not get tired. This is an attractive offer for those
who hire actors, however, it is very concerning for actors themselves."
660,S0020,3,"Generative AI's integration into organizational environments brings a complex
web of legal and ethical challenges, demanding an elevated level of ability. The
first biggest challenge of generative AI is having to deal with the issue of
copyright and intellectual property. With how fast the AI can produce information,
it requires the user to be careful and review the information being processed to
ensure no infringement on copyright or intellectual property. Data security and
misuse amplify the already intricate legal and ethical fabric. Unauthorized use of
generative AI for malicious intent or for generating harmful and deceptive content
can result in legal repercussions, including data breaches. Ethically,
organizations must make responsible AI use a priority and guard against misuse
for harmful purposes. Organizations must carefully evaluate the need for user
consent and transparency, particularly in interactions involving AI-generated
content. Ethical concerns arise when individuals engage with AI-generated
content without awareness, underscoring the importance of transparency and
informed consent practices. In conclusion, the integration of generative AI into
organizational contexts demands a holistic strategy to address the legal and
ethical dimensions. Organizations should set up precise policies and guidelines
to promote responsible AI deployment, uphold legal compliance, and cultivate an
ethical AI ethos. This multifaceted approach not only empowers organizations to
harness the capabilities of generative AI but also serves as a protective shield
against potential legal challenges and liabilities, ultimately fostering a dependable
and conscientious AI environment. (Screenshots Provided)"
661,S0021,3,"Alexander Simon has written an article in the community titled
“Responsible Digital Transformation: Navigating Ethical and Legal
Challenges through Design Thinking. In the article it speaks of the rise of
generative AI which leads to ethical and legal dilemmas. With the rise of
data privacy issues, an organization using generative AI can get more
insight into its users. If the organization uses that information it can rise to
ethical and legal challenges especially using data for crucial decisions like
granting loans. I also gathered from the community, that in addition to
data privacy, there are intellectual property rights, contract law,
competition law, and employment law businesses need to be aware of.
One of the big factors that Generative AI can have bias and fairness, as
generative AI is trained on large datasets that may contain biasses in the
data as well as Generative AI can be used to spread misinformation to a
large audience, it is important for organizations and users of generative AI
to consider ethical implications and conduct their own research as well to
make sure they are receiving unbiased and real information on certain
topics. To prevent the spread of misinformation and biased data,
organizations can have moderators of generative AI to check if the correct
information/ API is being pulled."
662,S0022,3,"When an individual is part of an organization and/or owns their own, many obstacles will come
in the way. Two of these obstacles are legal and ethical issues. Many individuals go into business
blind and get themselves into issues with other organizations, consumers, or the government.
One of the main legal issues is trademark violations. By using a generative AI technology you
risk taking or referencing others creations, branding, logos, etc that they own and are trademarks.
This leads to trouble and potential lawsuits. Another legal obstacle that comes with using
generative AI is making sure to comply with data protection laws. There are a lot of technical
rules about this, but in simple terms organizations have a certain obligation to uphold data
securely and with generative AI this can be breached. When it comes to ethical issues
organizations can face many obstacles due to certain AI outputs. At the end of the day,
generative AI is a database and there are only so many inputs. By researching all about it over
the past week, I have realized that generative AI does not have every answer and can cause
issues like the rest of us. Another ethical issue that comes to play is gaining the trust of
consumers. If a certain organization is using AI for marketing, production, structures, training,
etc this needs to be communicated or it can come off as inauthentic to consumers. All in all,
being aware of what you are putting"
663,S0023,3,"Using generative AI in an organizational setting, can diminish workplace work-ethic and can be
a huge risk to plagiarism which might not have been such an issue before. AI is decreasing the
amount of contributions people can make to their workplace and thus decreasing the necessity
for people-to-people interactions. Employers may feel inclined to replace employees by AI."
664,S0024,3,"Question 3: There are many heated debates as to whether or not AI is legally or ethically
appropriate. Many schools have even gone as far as to claim that it is plagiarism. There
is some sense behind this fallacious claim. It’s understandable to feel this way because it
is essentially regurgitating information that it has stored in its database and delivering it
in a way that is nearly identical to a college-level essay. Copying the information and
claiming it as your own simply because the information was not produced by a human is
questionable. Had it not been for the AI, that chunk of information would not exist. Reddit
user williamwhtjr1 said her sister thinks these tools devalue the human’s creative mind.
However a lot of us struggle with sources of inspiration as media and information
becomes more easily accessible to us. Technology has reached the point where it is
constantly advancing and so while the moral implications of AI usage may be blurred,
there’s no denying it can definitely help humans and companies get ideas better. Take
Midjourneys for example. Artists typically suffer from artist block and have no clue what
to draw next. By using Midjourneys, they can begin to form an idea as to what to draw
next. Or if an artist is beginning to draw, they may need reference photos. Generative AI
has the potential to advance society, so long as we employ a fair usage of it."

666,S0026,3,"3. Generative AI in organizational settings presents an abundant amount of legal and
ethical concerns discussed within the Dev.to community. One key legal issue is intellectual
property. When generative AI generates content, such as text or images, it can sometimes
infringe on copyright or trademark rights. Furthermore, Generative AI models learn from
existing data, which may contain biases. When applied in organizational contexts, this can
perpetuate unfairness in areas like hiring or lending decisions, potentially leading to
discrimination. Dev.to contributors highlight the importance of thoroughly auditing and
addressing these biases to ensure fairness. Privacy is another significant concern. Generative AI
can be used to generate convincing fake content, which can be exploited for malicious purposes,
such as deepfake videos. Organizations must navigate the ethical dilemmas of producing or
countering such content. Additionally, data security is crucial. AI models trained on sensitive
organizational data can become targets for cyberattacks. Ensuring robust data protection
measures is vital to prevent unauthorized access. Overall, Dev.to discussions underscore the need
for comprehensive legal frameworks and ethical guidelines to govern generative AI's use in
organizational settings. It's essential for organizations to be proactive in addressing these issues

667,S0027,3,"Artificial intelligence can pose many legal and moral problems in the future. Many people believe that artificial intelligence has the capability to destroy our society and the world. In many movies and theories, it is often a common theme that artificial intelligence often has an advantage over humans. They are able to be created stronger, faster, smarter, even possibly more intelligent than humans. Due to this, it is a possibility that they can even become our competitors. In this sense, artificially intelligent robots can possibly become our enemies. It is also theorized that if computers were given the gift of human-level intelligence, will they be able to contain the emotional quotient of humans as well? This is a very controversial question because if computers were able to process emotion, will they be aware of maltreatment or discrimination when integrated into our society? These are questions that are worth taking note of or put in consideration when developing these types of technologies, because believe it or not, artificial intelligence is our future. A notable movie that represents this topic is I-robot from Will smith. In the movie, his robot assistant and helper develops emotional intelligence and understands that he doesn’t want to be treated less than an equal. This leads the robot to become an enemy and try to destroy human society.

668,S0028,3,"There is a plethora of legal and ethical issues revolving around AI. A short list of these
issues are privacy concerns, security risks, transparency and accountability, and job
displacement. Starting with privacy concerns. The problem with AI as of now is that it can find
information from the web and use it, but it won’t always give credit to the original owner. Next
is the security risks. AI is a fairly new technology so it can still be susceptible to hackers trying to
put malicious software into the AI’s system. Transparency and accountability is the next
concern. The problem with this is that AI can make it difficult to explain the reasoning behind its
answers. It may not always be accurate either. As an example, you can’t have it giving out
medical or financial advice when it has never researched or truly studied every field. That is
where the ethical problem lies, which can turn into a legal concern. The last main point is job
displacement. Having AI everywhere removes the need for humans to work which makes
people lazy and just adds to the already excessive unemployment rates."
669,S0029,3,"The deployment of generative AI in organizational settings raises several legal and ethical issues
that need to be addressed, some of the key considerations to consider include but are not limited to
intellectual property and copyrights, data privacy and security, bias and fairness, misinformation
and deepfakes, accountability and transparency, unintended consequences, and unforeseen uses.
Generative AI in organizational settings does bring forth several legal and ethical concerns. Privacy

Kyle 6
is a significant issue, particularly when personal data is utilized for training AI models or generating
AI content. Organizations must abide by data protection regulations and ensure proper
anonymization and security measures to safeguard sensitive information and prevent data breaches.
Determining ownership of AI-generated content can be challenging, especially when it resembles
existing copyrighted or trademarked materials. Since AI models learn from existing data, biases
present in the data can be maintained, leading to unfair or biased outcomes. Organizations should be
completely transparent about the use of AI and clearly communicate to users when content or
interactions are generated by AI systems as it is crucial in maintaining user trust and ensuring
informed consent. Although, there are a lot of upsides to generative AI it also heightens the legal
and ethical challenges with a companies use."
670,S0030,3,"Thanks to Freeman, I was able to reach a conclusion for this question. The main problem for
AI-generated content is that there is some ownership ambiguity that surrounds it. One reason is
that generative AI is fed data in order to create new data. This means that it is using any data
including data that is protected by copyright laws. There are currently no laws that can stop this,
but there is a moral dilemma on whether this is acceptable. Not only is the AI able to use
whatever content it is fed, there is no clear ownership of who the new data that the AI created. AI
can also have its own biases when creating data due to the information that it is fed. This can
cause misleading data that is incorrect. For example, if you feed information to the AI that only
relates to certain demographics, then it is not valid for the overarching problem. People who used
the AI can lie and say that they used all of the data presented, but then they can just use some of
the data. This can cause confusion in an organization as there is no clear answer on whether the
creations of generative AI is usable. In order to reach an honest answer, there needs to be clear
ownership agreements, active bias monitoring and reduction, and proactive planning to ensure

responsible and ethical AI use in organizations. I think the government will start stepping in
when this starts to have an impact on companies on a large scale."
671,S0031,3,"According to Reddit.com the biggest legal issues with AI are copyright and intellectual
property issues and data privacy issues. The biggest ethical issue is the possibility of false
or biased information. I believe AI also takes away from user generated authenticity and

can lead to unaccountability."
672,S0032,3,"As mentioned before AI is not perfect, there are times when asking for a generated
answer, it might contain false information, and at times it might not have a reliable
source. From what I got from reddit, there are a few illegal issues that people who use AI
have to deal with. A few examples that were given by these redditors was that if someone
in a professional career like a lawyer, who decides to use a generative AI to build a case
on someone, might be at risk for using false information, entirely destroying their case,
and affecting someone’s life completely. It is important when using this tool, to do more
research, that way if the time comes the person who is using the tool can back up the
response with different resources that are proven to be reliable. There is another issue
when it comes to data being passed around. See there are times when a generative AI
might need to borrow information from certain sources, like government sources, huge
companies, etc. This is already an issue that has been discussed, if someone or a large
group can copyright a response from generative AI. There is a chance that very sensitive
data could be used in a negative way. The way I see it is the fact that people are
beginning to use generative AI, in the workplace, so imagine if there was some sort of
security breach from the AI, and it is able to steal very important information."
673,S0033,3,"Due to generative Artificial Intelligence being so new there are alot of concerns
around the programs offering this service. To combat these issues many have proposed the idea
of starting to create regulations for the use of AI. In fact, Elon Musk created a petition to stop the
progress of certain AI programs with the goal to help people sustain certain jobs and for AI not
to cause further problems within society. According to the reddit post, the three main legal and
ethical issues with generative AI are; false information, copyright infringement, and privacy
violations. False Information comes from the people or company that create the AI software. If
the people creating the software have bias, the software will also carry this bias in the product.
Secondly, a major ethical concern is copyright infrigement. Although all products of generative
AI are meant to be unique this is not always the case. AI creates the content based of content
already created by others, which can lead to new content containing pieces of already existing
content. This creates numerous legal complications and potential lawsuits for the companies
creating generative AI services. Finally, the last issue discussed in the reddit post was privacy

violations. This pertains to people being deepfaked or misrepresented by generative AI. This is
very dangerous for public perception and can put somebody’s integrity wrongfully in question."
674,S0034,3,"Q3: Emergency brings up many points about the legal problem of AI and its ability to create its
own product. One point is about intellectual property. In this case, it's hard for people to
determine the actual author. Even with a US federal judge going as far as stating that since there
is no author, it can’t be declared as property. There needs to be an author behind it so there can
be no legal disputes about the work that is created. Another point is bias and fairness, as seeing if
AI can be unbiased and avoid discrimination with its pattern recognition. A common case where
this is evident is when Google’s search engine brought two different images regarding two ethnic
groups. When you would search for three white teens, you’d see teens having fun, doing silly

activities, but if you search three black teens, the most common result would be three teens
mugshots. Because of the outrage from the public, Google had to patch this because their pattern
recognition found more black teens being incarcerated than a majority of other ethnic groups.
While pattern recognition is able to do wonders for society, such as finding similar items a user
may be looking for, if not checked on, can provide unhinged results that end with racial profiling."
675,S0035,3,"With the rapid evolution and proliferation of AI-generated technologies comes an increasing number of
legal and ethical challenges. These issues relate to intellectual property rights, plagiarism, data privacy,
bias, misinformation, liability, transparency, and employment, which are important factors for
organizations and individuals to consider when leveraging AI-generated content. Intellectual property
rights are one of the key issues associated with AI-generated content; when AI generates its own content,
it can be unclear who owns or copyrights it. Legal frameworks will need to adapt to this new reality. Data

privacy is another concern, and when AI processes large amounts of data, it needs to protect that data
and comply with privacy laws. Appropriate legal measures and regulations must be in place to prevent the
leakage and misuse of personal data.Bias in AI algorithms is an important issue from a fairness and
equality perspective. By using biased data sets, AI systems can produce unfair results. Ethical guidelines
and legal frameworks are required to eliminate bias and ensure fair results.The spread of misinformation
is another important issue: if AI-generated content generates misinformation, it can spread and have a
negative impact on society. To prevent the spread of misinformation, measures must be taken to ensure
the accuracy of information and to counter misinformation.Transparency and accountability are central
issues in AI decision making, and it is important that organizations be able to explain how AI-generated
content and decisions are made. Transparency refers to the ability of individuals and organizations to
understand and account for AI behavior and results. Responsibility requires clear accountability for
erroneous results and decisions.The widespread use of AI is also affecting employment. As some tasks
are automated, some jobs may be lost."
676,S0036,3,"Some legal and ethical issues associated with generative AI in organizational are that it
can risk promoting false information, infringe on copyright/intellectual property rights, and
violate privacy rights. Generative AI can create biased responses on faulty data or training from
researchers who worked on its programming. In addition, when generative ai creates responses

or content it is using data from other sources and can create ethical issues when it does not credit
others for their original content. Generative Ai can also use all the data it has been trained on to
generate responses, content, and other material that closely resembles the likeness of notable
people; since generative ai does not create compensation for said notable figure, it can create
problems for organizations. In regard to privacy, user input is collected by ai and interactions
must be protected and organizations must comply with existing protection laws and ensure that
user anonymity is protected; failing to protect users can create serious problems for
organizations.
Another issue about generative ai to keep in mind is that generative ai might be able to
replace humans the service industry. As generative ai become exponentially sophisticated many
entry level jobs are at risk of becoming obsolete."
677,S0037,3,"Generative AI can bring legal and ethical challenges for organizations. Privacy issues
may come up when personal data is used. Determining ownership of AI-generated
content can be very complex, and this may lead to an outburst of issues and concerns
for intellectual property rights. There is also a risk of bias in AI-generated content due to
the data it learns from, having the potential to spread negative stereotypes. I think
organizations must be clear about content being AI-generated. Keeping in mind these
challenges is very important to ensure data protection. The respect for intellectual
property, fairness, and overall transparency with AI must be taken into consideration for
future use of it."
678,S0038,3,"With the capacity that Generative AI has in terms of creating content there are a number of legal
and ethical concerns and issues associated with generative AI, especially in organizational
settings. One of the most key concerns include data privacy. The AIʻs work by going through a
vast variety of information to gain knowledge and create something from the data it inquired.
Some of this information may include personal and sensitive information. AI algorithms may get
their information from surveillance and monitoring of individuals without their explicit consent.
This raises the question, is it ethical to use someoneʻs personal data without their fully informed
consent? Although AI gives us a notification to understand how our data is tracked, individuals
donʻt fully understand how their own personal data is being used. Some of the most significant
legal matters of AI include intellectual property and ownership. Generative AI can create music,
images, art, literature at the command of itʻs user, but who owns the rights to this? The person
who owns the AI or the person who fed the data? Another ethical concern of AI, include how it
changes the dynamic of creativity and authenticity. There are boundless things we may be able to
use AI for, but there are moral limits to if we should or not. For example, creating music or art.
Artists of both industries will pour their heart and soul into the things they create, but AI can use
patterns and logic to create a similar result."

681,S0041,3,"With the use of generative AI in organizational settings there is definitely a rise in legal and
ethical concerns/issues. When generative AI makes a great advertising campaign comes the legal
questions like; Who owns that content? Does the AI itself own the content that it made or does
the individual who coded for the design and fine-tuned it from mistakes owns it? Or does the
company that generated the AI have ownership of the content. To avoid issues like this a clear
contract would have to be made between the person who is designing the content and the
company or have a clear law that defines ownership of the AI content being created. When it
comes to ethical issues revolving around AI, it can be seen through the biases of the AI algorithm
from old data, which can lead to unfair outcomes. Generative AI can also lead into the bias of
training data, that can cause discrimination in hiring or customer interactions, even if it is
unintentional. Ethical concerns can also be seen in job displacement if companies decide AI is
better and faster and more cost efficient than humans. When dealing with generative AI
organizations have to make sure that there is transparency and accountability in AI
decision-making , ensuring that they are following ethical and legal regulations."
682,S0042,3,"Generative AI, while can be useful and helpful in organizations with productivity, often
are wrapped around issues particularly to legal and ethical issues that arise in an organizational
setting. What are some of these legal and ethical issues? Let’s talk about it then. For the legal
issues, most commonly the issues that concern AI are legal rights issue and or intellectual
property issues as it was stated in question 1 about how generative AI works, it doesn’t recognize

the rights of what intellectual property goes to who as the rules that were placed by the
government still stand today and is often met with either criticism or legal complaints. What I
mean by this is that the whole issue of generative AI is a good thing often than not it can depend
on how the generative was made. Generative AI can lead to potential biases especially with the
training portion of it as it learns from the datasets or data given to it by the workers who work
with the AI and more often than not, can lead to biases depending on selective data given. The
ethnic issues of generative AI deals with the intellectual property portion of what was stated. As
the AI is non-biased towards everything but can quickly become biased based on the data that is
given and the issues of privacy with selective data. Going back to the topic of question 1, one
such example is AI art, where now it can be used by the public and in general but the rights of
which intellectual property goes to who can often lead to issues of credibility and can, more
often than not, hurt a reputation of a company if left unchecked."

The lawsuit against OpenAI underscores the question of whether AI developers can be
held legally liable for the content generated by their AI systems. If the court holds
OpenAI accountable for the false statements, it could set a significant legal precedent.
This might lead to increased regulation in the AI field, encouraging developers to
exercise greater caution and responsibility when creating and deploying AI systems to
mitigate potential harm.
The case emphasizes the limitations of AI, particularly in terms of information generation
and analysis. It can serve to educate the public about the fact that AI, while advanced, is
not infallible and can produce inaccurate or even harmful information. This
understanding of AI limitations could affect trust in AI systems and their widespread
adoption.
In the wake of this lawsuit, AI developers may be compelled to refine their AI systems to
minimize the potential for generating false or damaging statements. This could stimulate
innovation and advancements in AI technology, leading to the implementation of more
robust fact-checking and data validation mechanisms.
The case highlights the ethical responsibilities of AI developers and the organizations
using AI technology. If developers and companies can be held responsible for
AI-generated content, it could encourage more thoughtful and ethical practices in AI
development and deployment, pushing for transparency and safeguards to prevent harm.

The lawsuit may contribute to ongoing debates about the legal status of AI. If AI systems
can be held accountable for libel, it might prompt a re-evaluation of AI's legal standing.
This could lead to AI being recognized as a distinct legal entity in specific situations,
raising questions about AI's rights and responsibilities.
In summary, the legal and ethical challenges associated with generative AI in
organizational settings are complex and evolving. The outcome of the lawsuit against
OpenAI has the potential to reshape the legal landscape for AI developers and users and
foster a greater understanding of the role and limitations of AI in our society.

684,S0044,3,"Response: In the last question, the impressive possibilities of AI for positive change were
touched on; however, there are an equal amount of legal and ethical issues. The OKC explores 4
potential issues: misrepresentation, intellectual property issues, data privacy, and bias. As a result
of the generator and discriminator training AI to produce precise responses, malicious users can
create realistic looking data, images, videos, and more to manipulate others. An example may
include forgery, where a fake yet accurate response from an authoritative figure is used to
manipulate the actions of someone who cannot distinguish the forgery from reality. Next, since
generative AI is relatively new, the determination of data ownership has not been decided. To
elaborate, when AI generates intellectual property such as a video, song, or article, there is no
guidance on who that belongs to. It could belong to the public, the generator of the response, the
individual who inspired the generation; the ambiguity leads to confusion and potential ethical
issues. Additionally, when generating responses, AI scours the internet for any potential
information to aid in its effort. This may include personal information that will then be

remembered by the AI for an undefined amount of time, violating privacy protections expected
by the owners of the information. Lastly, many know that misinformation or biased information
is widespread on the internet. This lends AI to potentially presenting that information as fact
without realizing, providing an unknowingly inaccurate response to the user."
685,S0045,3,"According to Maurice Bretzfield, an AI and marketing consultant, quality and accuracy, lack of
accountability and responsibility, ethical implications of bias and discrimination, data privacy
and confidentiality, and professional competence and diligence are the legal and ethical issues in
generative AI. As generative AI relies so much on training data to generate outputs, if it is
balanced, completed, and updated, this can lead to accuracy and might have harmful results.
Lawyers must be cautious about relying on generated documents or analyses without a thorough
human review, ensuring the outputs’ quality, accuracy, and legality. The accountability issue is
one of the primary concerns with generative AI since the AI systems do not have legal agencies

or moral responsibility. It creates a challenging attribution to liability where generated AI work
can lead to adverse outcomes. The lawyers then assume the responsibility for the actions and
decision-making based on the AI-generated outputs. Generative AI systems can perpetuate biases
in the training data, amplify societal preferences, and lead to discriminatory outcomes. Lawyers
need to be careful of identifying and mitigating bias with AI systems to ensure fair and equitable
legal representation. Generative AI also carries many sensitive and confidential legal data. This
means lawyers must ensure that security measures are always in place to protect the privacy and
confidentiality of client information. Always consider potential risks of data breaches or
unauthorized access to AI-generated legal documents. Lastly, adapting to generative AI
introduces new challenges to legal professionals’ professional competence and diligence
requirements. Lawyers need to be trained and deeply understand the AI technology they use to
avoid overreliance, confirm accurate interpretations, and make informed decisions."
686,S0046,3,"Although there may be many benefits to generative AI, there are also ethical issues associated
with it as well. The third screenshot shows how it can risk using other people’s original work. It
can do this through copyright or reusing information already published on the internet.
Consequently, this jeopardizes intellectual property rights and undermines creators' efforts. It
can even be responsible for many job losses. AI technologies has already transformed various
industries, displacing workers and creating a need for reskilling and retraining. Additionally, it
can also contribute to privacy invasion as generative AI may involve sharing databases and
ensuring no data breaches occur is important. Maintaining data security and protecting
individuals' sensitive information become imperative when employing generative AI
technologies. Organizations must prioritize stringent data protection measures, incorporating
encryption protocols and robust security systems to safeguard against unauthorized access.
Even though generative AI offers tremendous possibilities, it comes with significant ethical
considerations. Copyright infringement, job loss, and privacy invasion are among the most
prominent issues associated with this technology. As the screenshot explains however, AI can
better information if used correctly and carefully depending on the organizations and its needs

of improvement. Making use of this innovative method should require some prior knowledge of
potential risks and precautions that must be taken."
687,S0047,3,"demand careful attention. From a legal standpoint, issues related to intellectual property rights
may arise, particularly concerning the ownership and usage of content generated by AI systems.
Determining the rightful ownership of generated content, especially in creative industries, can
lead to disputes and challenges in defining copyright and attribution.
Moreover, the use of generative AI for creating deceptive or misleading content raises concerns
about the potential infringement of privacy and data protection laws. If AI-generated content
involves personal data, organizations must adhere to relevant data protection regulations,
ensuring that data privacy is maintained throughout the generative AI processes.
Ethically, the responsible deployment of generative AI necessitates transparency and
accountability. Organizations should ensure that AI-generated content is clearly identifiable as
such to prevent the dissemination of misleading or false information. Maintaining transparency
builds trust with stakeholders and prevents potential reputational harm.
Additionally, the potential societal impact of generative AI on employment and job displacement
requires ethical deliberation. Automating tasks through generative AI can lead to workforce

displacement, necessitating strategies for upskilling or retraining affected employees to ensure a
just transition in the organization.
Furthermore, the potential misuse of generative AI for malicious purposes, such as the creation
of deepfakes for disinformation or fraud, underscores the need for robust regulations and
safeguards. Establishing ethical guidelines and industry standards for the responsible
development and use of generative AI is crucial to prevent its abuse and mitigate potential
societal harm.
In conclusion, the legal and ethical implications of generative AI in organizational settings
demand proactive measures to address issues related to intellectual property, data privacy,
transparency, societal impact, and misuse. Organizations must prioritize ethical considerations
and compliance with legal frameworks to ensure the responsible and sustainable integration of
generative AI into their operations."
688,S0048,3,"Summary:
The efficiency of AI is only getting more popular and more people are asking questions about how far AI
can go with its process. To go off what’s mentioned in the post about video games, AI has already shown
its power by creating characters and other components associated with them to learn its player’s functions
over time, AI has proved to be so efficient that it understands almost everything and bases it off the context
and information you provide. Outside of video games, AI provides lots of efficiency in fields like
healthcare, computer science, finance, and marketing since it can identify issues, offer solutions, and
provide relevant and resourceful information to the topic. In my opinion I think AI is only continuing to
evolve and it's our job to find innovative solutions, efficiency will continue to play a pivotal role in
shaping the future of technology and only seems to benefit most industries."
689,S0049,3,"Generative AI in organizational settings raises complex legal and ethical considerations.
At the heart of these concerns is the question of ownership. Ahmed from Quora contends that
when AI creates groundbreaking content or patentable inventions, it&#39;s unclear whether the
organization deploying the AI, the individual fine-tuning the model, or even the AI itself owns
the resulting output. This ambiguity can trigger legal disputes, necessitating clear guidelines and
contracts to define ownership.
Ethical worries also loom large. Ahmed further insists that Generative AI systems can
perpetuate biases present in their training data, unintentionally discriminating in areas like hiring
or customer interactions. Ensuring fairness and transparency in AI algorithms is paramount.
Proactive measures include monitoring, bias reduction through diverse training data, and
ongoing algorithm refinement.
AI&#39;s potential to displace human jobs is another ethical concern. Striking a balance
between efficiency gains and ethical workforce practices is crucial. Rather than layoffs,
organizations should invest in employee training and transition opportunities to shift them into
more strategic roles, demonstrating a commitment to responsible employment.
Proactively addressing these legal and ethical challenges is vital. Drawing from real-
world experience, organizations can consult legal experts, develop clear ownership frameworks,
and establish dedicated teams to monitor AI for bias. This ensures alignment with legal
regulations, ethical standards, and responsible business practices, ultimately allowing
organizations to harness generative AI&#39;s potential while navigating these complex waters adeptly."
690,S0050,3,"3) As I was
looking for legal complications with generative AI, I found a post
in my OKC. Someone pointed out that since AI is “fed”
information this could create content loaded with stereotypes.
It never occurred to me that stereotyping would be a major
problem in AI. It made me think of when job searching websites
were outed for using automated programs to look at resumes.
Due to the information given to the programs they overlooked
prime candidates and were found to be excluding certain
minorities. Some other things that we mentioned were
consumer data privacy. As stated above AI can be used to collect
data of the organizations user to better enhance their
experience. However, companies must be careful because they
have an obligation to keep consumer data private. Currently we
have seen an influx of company hacking which has leaked user

data. If they access the AI data, companies could be found liable for any data leak. Many posed
if using AI was ethical. One person even went as far as mentioning the current writer strikes that
are happening in Hollywood. Would it be ethical to use AI to take over those jobs? They would
not have to pay them or must worry about the AI striking, but would that really take the place of
human beings?"
691,S0051,3,"Q3. This discussion highlighted the legal and ethical implications surrounding the integration of
generative AI within organizational contexts. Key concerns revolved around issues of copyright
infringement, data protection, bias mitigation, and accountability, coupled with ethical
considerations related to job displacement and the propagation of misleading information. It was
suggested that to effectively navigate these challenges, organizations should establish
comprehensive ethical frameworks, promote transparency in AI practices, and actively address
the potential misuse of AI technologies. In summary, the incorporation of generative AI in
organizational settings prompts critical considerations regarding legal and ethical matters,
including copyright protection, data security, bias prevention, and organizational accountability.
Additionally, ethical concerns pertaining to workforce displacement and the dissemination of
false information underscore the need for stringent ethical guidelines, transparent AI practices,
and proactive measures to address potential misuses of generative AI technologies within
organizational contexts."
692,S0052,3,"When it comes to organizational settings, there are many legal and ethical issues that can
rise concerning generative AI. To begin, it should be ultimately important to reinforce that total
dependence on models such as ChatGPT should not be the norm, it should be used as a tool or a
framework. In addition, for this response, I think legal and ethical issues might go together and
are not ultimately separate from each other.
To further expand on ethics, and to reference the posts I screenshotted, the choice of
using generative AI is still always a choice. It is up to a person to decided what is best for them,
but there is always a chance someone will make their choice overly dependent on what the AI

model will provide to them. To continue, since these models are developed from already made
content, topics such as data privacy and bias are still a risk.
When it comes to data privacy, what is uploaded into the server is recycled repeatedly.
Over sensitive information can be spread and changed and altered. Organizations might
implement or require their workers to have their information shared.
There can be inherit biases present within the existing data they are building upon. AI
learns from society, and society is ultimately biased. For example, if we asked ChatGPT to look
for an image of a CEO, it might provide an example of a white male wearing a business suit.
Even though there are diverse CEOs, the historical bias displays there have been more white
CEOs in history than other races."
693,S0053,3,NaN
694,S0054,3,"Copyright is one of the biggest legal issues associated with generative
AI. This is a big problem with AI today, so it is imperative that the organizations creating these
generative AI applications follow the correct procedures to ensure the content being generated
follows the copyright laws. Another issue that generative AI encounters is the ethical issue of
these AI generators taking people&#39;s jobs. AI has the potential to take a lot of peoples jobs
because it does not need brakes or vacations it can work non stop unlike humans. So these
organizations that bring AI in to help improve their businesses need to think about the impact it
will have on their workforce. Also legal issues can come from the accuracy of the information
being presented by the AI. If the information given by an AI is incorrect or misleading the
organization that uses the AI can be held liable. So it is imperative for these organizations to
have tools in place for quality assurance. These are only some of the many legal and ethical
issues that are associated with generative AI. Even though there are a lot of issues, generative
AI can still be used effectively, with the right precautions in place."
695,S0055,3,NaN
696,S0056,3,"- The number one way generative AI can have legal and ethical issues is through copyright
claims. A discussion I came across thoroughly explores this issue by dictating the issues in the
legal and ethical departments when using this type of technology for artistic creation. The
problem arises when generative AI utilizes a sample dataset to generate outputs that replicate the
training sample’s content. This can result in outputs that ultimately plagiarize the original
dataset, making this practice illegal and downright unethical.
It is also important to note that the law currently does not clarify what data samples can be used
to train commercial AI models. The flowchart below showcases the law a little bit more, but
upon researching and going into another forum, this graph actually only symbolizes a large
amount of legal uncertainty, and nobody knows what is or isn&#39;t legal yet. Another thing to note is
that because of this, we will eventually need a stricter and more specific guideline when it comes
to intellectual property rights. Organizations right now have some structure in terms of vision,
mission, and values that dictate rules of art ownership, but there is a disparity in approaches, with
other companies being more lenient as well, further necessitating a future towards standardized
regulations."
697,S0057,3,"Generative AI use a database of real work by real artists, which means the output generated by AI could be sourced from a copywrite protected media. This could cause an artist work to be devalued by AI generated interpretations of the art they created. Leave can leave a company liable for a lawsuit. Another big issue with AI is the fact that AI will make up results to satisfy the request at hand, and with business, you need hard facts. There have been examples of lawyers using ChapGPT to help the build a case for court, only to find out the underlying cases used were entirely fictious.
From an ethical standpoint, AI can be used to replace human workers in a way that does not necessarily generate new jobs for the displaced workers. This creates a problem for society because there will be people who will be out of work who are qualified and willing to work. Most innovation in human history replace jobs (like a milkman or a Ferrier), but these innovations tend to generate jobs themselves. For example, cars replaced horses as a primary mode of transportation, but these jobs that once tended to horses started to disappear, being replaced by jobs building cars, building roads, selling parts, and other jobs generated for a car.
"
698,S0058,3,"A lot of the ethical/legal issues associated with generative AI come with what is used to train
these models. It seems as if pretty much everything publicly produced can be used in some way to train
AI models that can be used by anyone. The problem is that most content was not produced with this in
mind, and it would be impossible for creators to have consented to this during the time of their
production. A lot of artists, writers, and people in general are now claiming to be against the use of their
work/posts to train AI. Legal trends seem to be on these creators’ side since, as one member of the
subreddit posted, AI-generated art would not be able to be copyrighted according the to U.S. Copyright
Office.
Another ethical question comes with whether we are prepared for what comes with
organizations having the tools generative AI can provide. One poster in the community posted a
Forrester projection that predicts that by 2030, 2.4 million jobs will be lost due to generative AI
technology. On the other hand, however, people could argue that generative AI is no more threatening
to jobs than normal technological advancement, since that same projection predicts that a higher
number of jobs will be lost to automation of varying types."
699,S0059,3,"The first legal issue I saw with generative AI with copyright protection that is used to train new
models. Companies are urging lawmakers to regulate the datasets used for training and
consent of rights holders before the use of their data. Ways to regulate this would be allowing
companies to negotiate with the AI model operators and require AI operators to eliminate any
type of misinformation that could be put out. Another obvious ethical issue, that I’m sure many
professors have already dealt with, is people using generative AI to do their work for them.
Organizations can use it to write documents or even legal briefs. With people using AI to write
for them also comes real legal issues. I read an article that Microsoft’s MSN News published an
AI-generated article about a former NBA player passing away with a headline saying he is
‘useless”. It stated how the rest of the news report was incomprehensible. If something as
serious as an obituary is not proofread before being published imagine how many more stories
could make it to the media that include false information, heartless or rude opinions, or even
racist content. Another ethical issue is someone training a model with bad intentions. I read that
there are new ways for the operator to have more control over the content that is generated and
they are using it to put hidden messages into images."
700,S0060,3,"There are many legal and ethical issues associated with Generative AI in organizational settings
such as:
● Copyright
● Intellectual Property
● Harmful Bias
● Unemployment
One of the biggest concerns when it comes to Generative AI is its power and capabilities,
especially in organizational settings. Generative AI is capable of creating high-quality outputs in
a matter of seconds, and this poses an issue with employment. It can complete tasks at a
quicker rate than humans with almost equivalent or better quality, and employers don’t have to
pay for labor. For example, “Forrester predicts that Generative AI will replace 2.4 million US jobs
by 2030.”
Another legal and ethical issue with the use of Generative AI is copyright and intellectual
property. Generative AI creates new content based on already existing data, and this means it
references artwork from human creators and artists without their permission. This is a legal
issue because of the copyright infringement of the creator’s work that was used to train and
inspire the model.

Edra 6
Lastly, an ethical issue that is concerned with Generative AI is that it may create content that
has a harmful bias. One example of this was provided in the article recommended by a Redditor
in which a human might input the prompt of producing an image of a CEO, and the AI would
most likely replicate and produce images of white middle-aged men due to the existing data in
the training model. This is an example of how models follow data without considering harmful
biases."
701,S0061,3,"Based on my opinion, there will be a lot of legal and ethical issues especially when we talk
about job security in welcoming AI into the workplace. An example is one of the comments in
the post that I created about Job security and AI.

The commenter stated that in a capitalist country like the United States, humans will still be able
to secure jobs because it is a necessity in capitalism that there will be no market if there are no
jobs available. Companies and businesses will be forced to generate jobs just to keep the
market working.
The issue of job security in integrating artificial intelligence comes up when we need to replace
certain jobs that are being worked by humans with AI. This could lead to unemployment, layoffs,
and economic instability. To avoid this, companies should develop a plan to ensure that
employees work with AI to improve performance and productivity. Another problem that could
occur is the potential for bias in the algorithms used in generative AI. Some AIs are trained for
specific algorithms and biased data which may produce biased results leading to discrimination
and inequality in the workplace. If the company integrates AI into the system, it should be
trained on unbiased and diverse data to avoid discrimination in the workplace.

What has been prevalent right now is the creation of deep fakes and other forms of
misinformation which are specifically evident in social media. Companies should make sure that
the data in the AI system are filtered for privacy and security. Specific guidelines and rules
should be created to maintain credibility in the company resources."
702,S0062,3,NaN
703,S0063,3,"“Legal and ethical concerns include data privacy, intellectual property,
and bias in AI-generated content. Organizations must navigate regulations, ensure data
protection, and address AI-generated content that may be misleading or offensive”. This means
that in the legal and ethical issues, generative AI is protecting you with your private data that you

don’t want it to go out in public. Like for example of that in my opinion, I think that in your
internet browser on a social media platform, you can keep your Facebook Account private for
nobody to see except your friends, or say for example you were downloading something really
suspicious and the Robot AI was saying “this file is dangerous and may damage your computer,
are you sure you want to download it” and that is true for a lot of software in the generative AI.
For my MacBook, I made sure to keep it safe from any virus that comes to my computer, I
download only stuff that is mostly safe and important like work, school stuff, to-do list, etc. The
best way to download any specific stuff is always to use ChatGPT which can help me decide
what is safe and not safe, it depends on what software it is."
704,S0064,3,"Since Generative AI is a relatively new and very powerful technology, there have not
really been any regulations created when it comes to legal and ethical issues. A big ethical issue
that is talked about is the issue of AI programs learning to be prejudiced and biased towards
others due to the biases and attitudes of humans. AI needs data from the real world, this means
that AI could analyze data and find a pattern that is biased towards certain people based on the
actions and beliefs of humans---it’s no secret that many institutions have had and continue to
have prejudiced views and practices---and then incorporate these biases into its work in turn
discriminating against those people. Furthermore, another big issue that is talked about is job
automation, which is the replacement of human jobs by machines. If companies start to rely on
AI to do certain jobs rather than having to pay someone a living wage, this will make a lot of

jobs obsolete and hurt society. An example that comes to mind is the replacement of cashiers
with self-checkout which has greatly reduced the number of jobs in the field and keeps getting
worse as more and more stores decide to implement them. When it comes to legal issues, the
main one that users in the subreddit r/AskReddit talked about was who is to blame when AI fails.
Since AI is a technology, there will always be chance that it could malfunction or glitch, so
where does the blame fall when something like this happens and someone ends up hurt? A user
on the subreddit brought up the example of self-driving cars, if one of these cars malfunctions
and ends up hurting someone, you can’t really blame the driver since they were not the ones
driving and you could only blame the corporation to an extent."
705,S0065,3,"Some ethical issues associated with generative AI in organizational issues is job displacement
due freeing up jobs that are able to be performed by artificial intelligence. Examples could
include customer service representatives, as mentioned in my previous answer, being replaced by
virtual assistants. Populations may harbor ill feelings if an organization for instance, lets an
entire department go due to this. There must be a balance in improving efficiency while
contributing to society through the maintenance of jobs. Generative AI can also give a rise to
legal issues such as copyright infringement. Since generative AI relies on past data, it may take
parts previous work that is protected. For instance, a marketing campaign that uses generative AI
can get in legal trouble if their material includes artwork that is protected by copyright.
Additionally, if AI is trained on biased information, it could lead to discrimination in hiring
processes for instance. It is vital that AI be used responsibly and monitored in the workplace to
avoid these situations. Generative AI is helpful and can help improve service, ideas, and
efficiency, but overly relying on it can also create legal and ethical situations, which not only
hurt society but the image of an organization as well."
706,S0066,3,NaN
707,S0067,3,"What I found in my community in reddit is that AI helps organizations tremendously but there is one
factor that brings concerns and that is fraud and privacy. AI is used to obtain data but not necessarily for
protecting. Addressing this would be having regular audits, which I believe having human eyes would be
beneficial. Ongoing monitoring and audits of the actual AI system would help in organization settings. If
there are no monitoring or audits within an organization who heavily uses AI, there could be a decline in
consumer trust. This damages and creates a loss of the business. I think this is very important with
organizations who rely heavily on data. A real life example that would be a perfect example regarding
this is how MGM and Caesars Entertainment had a major cyberhack in which the casinos had to pay
millions of dollars to obtain their data back. This has caused many people to not trust their data with
MGM and casinos in general."
708,S0068,3,"With generative AI there are legal and ethical issues that may arise. Just like with any
technology, it is constantly learning and doesn’t necessarily have a moral compass to
guide itself upon. For people using these technologies I find it is important to always
make any finishing touches and edits to avoid any accidental hateful or insensitive
rhetoric the AI may generate. Especially in a social climate that rightfully doesn’t allow
room for error of such things. In the legal capacity generative AI has already faced
backlash for stealing works from people and not properly crediting the original creator.
Just like with any writing it is important to avoid plagiarism and AI is still not perfected
enough to avoid doing so. There has also been recent backlash against illustrative
generative AI and digital artists who have been able to identify their own signatures
within this kind of art. Then ethically I believe that a computer cannot easily mimic the
same work as a diversified workforce that can tread through the ever-changing social
climate and its nuances. We have seen time and time again of companies using
technology to do work and getting in trouble for not reviewing the contents that can come
off as offensive."
709,S0069,3,"Question #3: While Generative AI provides many offerings, there are also a high number of
risks that may jeopardize a business or organization if not aware of them. This form of AI can be
used to generate fake content, such as text, pictures, or videos. Any of these can be easily spread
as untrue statements or opinions or even fake news regarding organizations. Generative AI
models are able to initiate breaches of trademarked information that may potentially lead to
ruining the influence of a company and any legal disputes that will go along with it. AI can also
commit fraud through false advertisements and producing false products under brand
impersonation. To prevent these risks from occurring, businesses should invest in secure
authentication methods and educate their employees through comprehensive training, regarding
protocols, security methods, and how to deal with misinformation. Businesses and organizations
should always be on the lookout for suspicious activities on all social media platforms.
Abdoullaev says, “[Businesses] should also invest in AI experts and legal advisors who can
provide guidance on compliance, intellectual property rights, and privacy regulations, and
ensuring businesses operate within legal boundaries.” (Abdoullaev, 2023) It is crucial to educate
about risks and to invest in these strategies to ensure success."
710,S0070,3,"Many new world inventions are emerging such as Generative AI or self-driving cars and with them come a volley of legal and ethical issues we have never had to face before. One of the issues of Generative AI is ownership. Since the AI is retrieving its data from multiple sources whether that be manually inputted or taken from the web, we are left with unclear lines as to where we stand. Is it the operator of the AI that receives ownership or do the people whose content was used to aid in the creation receive some stake? There is an interesting divide If AI utilizes your creations such as art. Your content is unique and if there are any designs or text directly ripped off of another piece of content in its work it would be called a “Derivative work”. If those people aren’t compensated or the proper credits aren’t given, they would be claiming your work as their own. This leads us to our second issue, how are they retrieving this data? Questions arise about how and where these people or AI are receiving this information,
Are the methods they use legal? With new versions of AI coming out around the world, we must keep an eye on their capability and reach. By limiting this evolving process we are able to ensure that there are no breaches of information or security. 
"
711,S0071,3,"Some of the legal and ethical problems as Chat GPT put it I feel are some of the biggest issues
which has to do with the issue of Liability. If AI starts to produce harmful content who is to
blame as the problem can fall on the promptee, or prompted. From one point of view the
company used let’s say Chat GPT and it gave them harmful content would you blame the
company for what it asked or would you blame GPT for what it reasoned? We need to remember
that AI like Chat GPT learn from us so what we say to them can be viewed as fact and it might
not catch on to the fact that what we trained them for is the incorrect way of producing things.
Some ethical problems also arise from human creators, if AI is able to pump out text, music, and
art would that in itself be a monopoly because 1 human creator takes time to do things AI can do
all the humans can do in a much shorter time span? A real-world example is the current writer
and actor strikes as companies want to use AI likeness without paying the actors shows the legal
and ethical problems of AI."
712,S0072,3,"a) It seems that issues based on legality and ethics do arise from using this
technology. Generative AI uses training data which can be manipulated to tasks
the user wants it to produce. Users can input malicious data to create bias on
certain agendas to alter the output of the AI. There are also issues revolving
copyright. Since AI creates its product using data, it is possible that it can create
content that are similar to ones that are already published or created by someone.
It is also possible for AI to breach privacy of individuals. As mentioned
previously on how data can be manipulated, data can also contain personal
information that it may share or even generate information using personal data."
713,S0073,3,"There are some legal issues associated with generative AI in organizational settings. One of the
main issues seems to be with AI’s ability to generate fake content and therefore result in potential

harm. For example, spreading or using the wrong information could create problems that lead to legal
issues. Similarly, false information could lead to financial and economic problems and cause fraud or
even extortion. Furthermore, there are legal issues relevant to privacy. In order to get trained, AI could
steal personal information without proper permission. Generative AI is questionable in its transparency,
and therefore users have to be cautious. Without proper awareness, it could save pieces of information
about the organization or its customers. Although some places are working on regulations related to
that, the process has been going slowly.
     Another is that there are some ethical issues associated with generative AI in organizational settings.
One of the main issues seems to be that AI creating problems with workers. There were some concerns
among writers regarding AI taking over their jobs. The writers were also upset by how their previous
works were used to train AI engines. Not only with writers, but there are also concerns among artists
about their images being used for training. They don’t want organizations to use their work for AI
training without permission and without proper compensation for it. The limit doesn’t stop there. By
using the ability to automate tasks, low-skilled jobs that are repetitive might get taken by AI. This
could mean a lot of people might lose their jobs and become unemployed due to organizations
choosing convenience and lower costs."
714,S0074,3,"First and foremost, there is the ethical aspect of organizations trying to portray AI-
generated content as something more than just synthesized content. Profit motives are what drive
the functioning of organizations, so they would be willing to act obverse to user interests with
damning implications for the society that we are part of. This is particularly true if behemoths
like Facebook and Google were to resort to coercion and subversion on a grand scale, leading to
psychological brainwashing of the masses. It is a known fact that Facebook and Google train
their algorithms on user data that they keep collecting at mind-boggling rates every day. Given
that there is no clarity regarding what drives these algorithms, there is every chance that they
may work to corrupt, falsify, and mislead through their generative AI content. Many experts
have even gone so far as to say that these algorithms could prove to be harmful to humanity if
they are not kept under check. The ethicality of allowing these algorithms produced by the
megacorps to run unobstructed and unabated is then definitely brought into question. 

   Alongside, legal questions also arise when organizations resort to data mining in an
untrammeled way without paying heed to user&#39;s rights to privacy. In this regard, the question of
reconciling fair use of data against learning from scraped data also emerges. To what extent
should organizations have the right to use data that is freely available? Should there be a
threshold in place? In which case, who or which agency should reserve the right to impose such a

GENERATIVE AI
threshold? There remain myriad questions regarding the fair use of data for producing generative
AI content that has both legal and ethical implications for the organizations that use such data.
Our ambivalence toward the issue will provide greater leeway to organizations to break ethical
boundaries and further their heinous agendas. The onus then is on the masses to ensure that
effective barriers remain in place so that organizations work on generative AI content without
imperiling the privacy of individuals and detesting from propagating any kind of falsehoods in
society."
715,S0075,3,"There are a multitude of possible legal and ethical issues involving the use of
generative ai in organizational settings. The
main issue that I listed in the previous question
is the prospects of many jobs being deemed
useless because ai is able to accomplish the
tasks at a much more efficient rate and for
much cheaper. So it is simply common sense
that companies will move towards cutting
payroll and relying on generative ai to
accomplish the more mundane tasks previously
needed by humans. This will cause a massive
increase in unemployment and seemingly
unforeseeable consequences to the nation as a
whole. This is best exemplified by an issue that
is currently still ongoing in the real world and
that is the writers strike. With the evolution of
generative ai we really don’t need writers
anymore. With growing advancements ai will
be able to add the human feel to entertainment
which will very likely push many writers out of a job. It will surely be a tough balancing act
moving forward as generative ai will continue to become better at everything it does, even to the
point of being better at human related activities than humans are, which is a scary thought
depending on how you look at it."
716,S0076,3,"Question 3: Its fascinating to see each of these questions are building on to each other by
accident due to me exploring the reddit threads in question one! Just as I recently stated,
Microsoft is getting sued for using Generative AI to reproduce open-source code. I also found
another thread that was in /ChatGPT subreddit that described another individual suing ChatGPT.
This man is named Mark Walters, and he is suing because it gave false information about him
and could cause harm to his reputation. The lawsuit argues that companies with OpenAI should
be held liable and responsible for the AI’s mistakes. I was looking at the comments on this thread
and saw that someone states that ChatGPT explicitly says that it could give false information
because it is still learning.
I’d like to argue that it’s ethically wrong for AI to replace someone in the workplace.
However, it could be a temporary replacement while trying to find a new human employee. Due
to this AI still growing and developing it can&#39;t exactly be trusted to give factual information.
Though the more thought that is put into it, Humans are the same. The only difference between
AI and Humans is that humans are allowed their own opinions. While AI can only give facts on
the information that is fed to them by humans. The more I type the more I realize that this
technology can actually be manipulated if in the wrong hands."
717,S0077,3,"According to an understanding I got on Quora, although artificial intelligence (AI) can
analyze and generate new data, its asset ownership is somewhat vague. For
example, if artificial intelligence (AI) creates a breakthrough technology on its own,
then it will benefit Is it the company that uses the technology, the technician who
adjusts the technology, or the person who develops the technology? Therefore, this
ambiguity will lead to legal controversy.
At the same time, the data for artificial intelligence AI is obtained online. I personally
think that it analyzes the data in big data. If someone publishes some answers with
discriminatory meanings and the artificial intelligence accepts them, then it may
inadvertently discriminate against some groups of people and bring trouble to the
people or organizations using the artificial intelligence. In addition, I think that if the
paper inadvertently generated by artificial intelligence does not correctly cite other
people&#39;s citations, it may also cause legal problems, such as infringement, etc., and
errors. Accept some"
718,S0078,3,"With Generative AI being a relatively new innovation, there arises legal and ethical
issues that can occur. Like what was explained in a previous question, Generative AI
uses data that is inputted from a user or a set of users. This can be a potential issue
because the information given can come from unethical motives which will in turn create
an unethical Generative AI that will not provide any beneficial use. When researching
about those legal and ethical issues on this online knowledge center, a user provided a
link to a relevant website that discussed this topic. It explains how generated content
created from Generative AI is in an interesting position where there aren’t any direct
rules/laws about it but people should still be aware of what can and cannot be made
using Generative AI. It discusses how users should be mindful of copyright and
intellectual property because the data and information being used by Generative AI can
be previously owned and copyrighted already. Like I discussed, Generative AI is more of
a way to make current things better not necessarily making a whole new thing. This can
lead to many legal and ethical issues because a valid claim can be made for the majority

of Generative AI which I believe will be more prevalent in the future when laws and
regulations are set in place."
719,S0079,3,"Question 3: Inside and outside of an organizational setting, generative AI has many legal and
ethical issues. The issue that stands out the most is stolen intellectual property. The lines of who
owns the content created are blurred which makes it difficult to figure out ownership and rights
to the created content. This leads to issues of copyright and plagiarism. Generative AI has to

analyze already created content to create its own generated content. This means the content
created can look a lot like the original which can be copyrighted and create plagiarized content.
This means the organizations can face many legal issues and pay large fines for reproducing
content with paying and/or crediting. Generative AI has also created many issues that involve
misinformation. One big ethical issue is deep fake videos. These videos involve usually a well-
known public figure being edited to look like they are saying and/or doing actions that aren’t
real. For an organization, this can make or break their business if they are misinforming or look
like they are misinforming which ruins their reputation, loss of business, and/or legal issues.
Who is liable for these issues also becomes an issue since it is not easy to tell who is at fault."
720,S0080,3,"I found a great thread on this question that had a lot of engagement and user response. Based on
what most users are responding to, one of the largest legal and ethical issues associated with AI is
privacy and data usage. With AI pulling from databases and information it already has in its system,
you have to wonder if any of it is stuff that may breach a user´s privacy. I have never tried asking it
information on anyone I know, so I don´t know the lengths of this, but I could see how it is a valid
concern. Another issue that was raised in the thread is that of replacing humans with AI programs.
One example was that of the current writer´s strike that was happening and how many companies
may be looking into AI to write programming/movies because there is no person that they have to
pay, AI doesn´t get sick, etc. The implications of this could be extremely challenging in a world
where most of us want that human touch, but it would ultimately save companies big bucks.
Personally, in my line of work, if AI is not given the correct prompts and the information put out by
it is not reviewed, it could lead to a world of legal issues because the AI program does not know how
to interpret any laws or information, I give it to include in an email or post. Thus, everything has to
be monitored and fact checked."
721,S0081,3,"Generative AI presents a number of ethical issues in organizations. First, the issues of data
privacy with users. A number of people would say that the tracking of their information is
against their rights and makes them uncomfortable.
An issue that both reddit and chatgpt discussed was copyright issues. Generative AI uses images
and data without copyright improvement to train AI models. This presents both legal and ethical
issues.
There are also the issues with legal accountability. How do you regulate generative ai on a legal
platform? How can you moderate a program that analyzes user data? When AI oversteps,
discussing how to enforce discipline will be a large debate.

It is crucial to ensure human oversight of generative AI systems to promote ethical and
responsible use. This oversight involves monitoring the system&#39;s generated content and
intervening when necessary to prevent potential harm. Content moderation serves as one of the
key measures for oversight. As generative AI systems advance, the content they produce may
only be suitable and safe for specific audiences. To address this, developers aim to filter out
harmful or biased content and implement mechanisms that activate when a user searches for
potentially harmful results."
722,S0082,3,"Figuring out what data sets to train one’s organization on can decide whether or not there are threats or not. The liability can be held due to negligence or fraud that results from the use of a chat bot. Regulation can be a factor too with many new AI works coming into play in the generative AI space governments may not be so sure on some AI tools. Owning the data input and output can raise some issues from within. This can be an issue regarding responsible AI. Many of this AI is all new which is why it can be hard to tell if it is safe or right. Privacy can be an issue if personal data is included in large language model training data. AI can be biased sometimes too which is why some discrimination could occur. Copy rights and legal exposure raise some issues. Harmful content could be distributed which can be harmful because AI can generate this content even if it doesn’t exist in real life. Organizations need to train their AI in the responsible way to ensure its safety for the employees and customers. The benefits can outweigh the negatives if the AI is conducted ethically. With AI being so complex sometimes issues can arise since it is new technology that can mimic human behavior that can sometimes be unpredictable to an extent. 
"
723,S0083,3,"One issue associated with generative artificial intelligence that I came across was false
information involving Chatgpt, an AI chatbot.. Chatgpt got sued by Mark Walters for slander and
false information. Chatgpt told a reporter that Mark was stealing money from a foundation,
which ended up being false. When opening the website, there is a disclaimer that the bot could
spread misinformation and individuals are using this as a reason for Chatgpt to not be
responsible. Even with this warning, others are saying that these AI companies should be
responsible for the spread of misinformation. There is lots of gray area since this is still an
ongoing case but I find it interesting how this one of the first lawsuits of its kind and will set a
precedent for future cases like this one. I believe that AI is not perfect and can make mistakes
just like humans, even though it&#39;s less likely to happen. But just like humans, the companies
should be held accountable for the misinformation that can harm one’s reputation or image. I am
looking forward to finding out how this case goes and what the court rules. It is an important
decision that will affect the future of AI."
724,S0084,3,"There are a handful of legal and ethical issues that are associated with generative AI in
organizational settings. When it comes to ethics, it is all about communication. Organizations
must be transparent with their staff and their consumers about their use of AI and the role that
generative AI plays when it comes to their products and services. This is essential in order to
establish a line of trust between the organization and the consumer.
The legal side is where it becomes a little bit more tricky. The main one would be centered
around data privacy/protection laws. Generative AI uses a user’s personal data/information in
order to generate some if not most of its outcomes. Organizations must make sure that their AI is
in line with these laws and regulations that are in place. Another legal issue would involve
intellectual property and copyright infringement. Since the content is AI generated, it can create
a gray area when it comes to identifying who owns the right to the content. Organizations must
be wary of this and avoid using and exploiting copyrighted material. Furthermore, if the content
generated by AI is used with the intention of manipulating the public it can lead to many legal
issues. These organizations and companies have to keep that in mind and prevent using
generative AI in a way that wasn’t intended."
725,S0085,3,"From the responses that I have read, there are multiple ethical and legal issues that are associated
with generative AI within an organizational environment. One issue that was mentioned was the concern
with data privacy of an organization from others. This is a reasonable concern as generative AI works in a
way where it uses all data that it is accessible to, in order to generate the data that is needed. If
organizations are not careful with protecting their data, there could be potential data leakages to its
competitors. Another concern that was mentioned was the relationship between AI and intellectual
property. Intellectual properties have rules and regulations that are placed to protect them. These
regulations could be inadvertently infringed by AI if the system is not programmed properly. In scenarios
where AI doesn't follow the regulations that are in place for intellectual property, it will result in legal and
ethical issues for organizations. An ethical concern was a potential biased output created by the generative
AI. The data that AI takes its information from could possibly be biased or created in an unfair way. If
this is the case, this means that the output that the AI produces will be biased, leading organizations to
operate off of biased information."
726,S0086,3,"Generative AI carries many legal and moral challenges that require careful consideration to make sure
organizations use these technologies wisely and responsibly.
- Institutions will have to deal with data privacy regulations and the potential misuse or
unauthorized access to sensitive information while training Generative AI models.
- Sometimes, AI can learn biases from the data it's trained on, which can lead to unfair results. To
prevent this, humans should check AI-generated content to make sure it's fair and makes sense,
especially for important decisions.
- There's also a worry that AI-generated content might copy someone else's work, and figuring out
who owns it can be tricky.
- If a company uses Generative AI to make important choices, they might get into trouble if things
go wrong.
- There's another issue about whether the information AI produces is reliable. We need to be sure
AI-generated content doesn't spread false info or try to trick people because it can hurt trust and
reputation.
- As more organizations use Generative AI to do the work, it might mean less jobs for people,
which can lead to higher unemployment rates. Organizations should think on how to train
humans to do jobs that AI can’t do or help workers learn new skills and dive deeper on
innovation and more complex matters.
- There's also this new term called “deepfake”, which is all about using AI and deep learning to
create “synthetic media” or fake content, often in the form of manipulated videos or audio
recordings. These can basically change the reality of things and confuse people, it can be used

for voice cloning, data manipulation, evasion of security systems, disinformation campaigns and
corporate espionage.
- Another big issue will be an environmental one. It's unbelievable how large-scale AI models
need so much energy, which can hurt the environment. Organizations need to be careful about
this.
- Lastly, we should make sure older workers can use this new tech, or there might be a gap
between generations, and people might feel frustrated if their skills aren't needed anymore.
To navigate the ethical and regulatory challenges tied to Generative AI, organizations should establish
clear usage guidelines, regularly conduct ethical audits, and stay informed about evolving regulations.
Transparency, data governance, and accountability should be prioritized, with an emphasis on educating
employees and ensuring legal compliance. Continuous improvement and the promotion of a responsible
AI culture are vital components of addressing these multifaceted concerns."
727,S0087,3,"Although generative AI may seem extremely helpful and revolutionary, it does have its flaws.
Generative AI does still require human intervention in order to monitor the content it produces to
make sure it is accurate so it cannot be trusted on its own. Upon reading some legal cases with
the use of generative AI, I was able to read about how chatGPT got sued which demonstrates
how it cannot be fully trusted and can be controversial. The case I read upon was a man named
Mark Walters is suing OpenAI’s chatbot because the chatbot told a reporter he was stealing
money, ultimately making false accusations about him. Walters is trying to prove that not only

can chatbots be dangerous but they have the power to cause destruction by harming someone&#39;s
reputation. Walters utilized the AI to generate his court summary which falsely accused him of
participating in the crime which he did not commit. From this case, it could potentially have
important implications for the future use and development of AI which could hinder the
credibility of the system. Although there are many other limitations to AI, these are just some
things to consider with the ethical side of generative AI and how it can do more harm than good."
728,S0088,3,"Although generative AI offers a great number of potential benefits for companies, it also brings
up quite a few legal and ethical issues. Privacy is a major issue when personal data is used as the
foundation of AI-generated content. Organizations must comply with data protection regulations
and make sure that data is properly anonymized in order to prevent breaches. There are also
concerns related to intellectual property rights, especially when AI-generated content is involved.

As AI-generated content is becoming increasingly popular, determining the owner of specific
content can be extremely challenging. An ethical concern about generative AI includes the risk
of bias in AI-generated content, which can cause stereotypes or misrepresent information. Since
AI learns from information and data being “fed” to it, the information may contain biases or
harmful information. This could potentially be extremely harmful to society if the information is
being misrepresented to society. Organizations should also be transparent in the fact that their
information is AI-generated. In conclusion, even though generative AI offers many positive
potentials, it also raises profound legal and ethical challenges. Therefore, it is very important that
organizations navigate these issues in order in order to ensure data protection, intellectual
property considerations, transparency, equitable representation, and responsible use of AI."
729,S0089,3,"The use of generative AI in organizational settings can raise legal and ethical
issues. These mainly revolve around copyright, intellectual property and creativity. An
example I found when reading through the community was about how some generated
information includes direct copies from other content. This would mean that you would
be completely unaware when using somebody else’s ideas and not giving credit where
credit is due.
Another issue as I mentioned before, is with creativity. Generative AI should not
be doing all the work for you. It should just be a tool that can guide or inspire your work.
If your work was completed entirely by generative AI, it would be lacking your imput.
Generative AI may stump creativity because it makes it possible to almost think for us.
A specific example brought up in the group was of the increased use of generative
AI in the entertainment industry. Generative AI is able to mimick the voice of an artist,
their style and create new songs. This causes the same issue mentioned before, where is
credit due? Not only that but generative AI has the ability to create new songs for artists.
This could mean replacing the roles that writers play in creating a song."
730,S0090,3,"o AI has been an incredible innovation to the constantly developing technology
community. Although it is an amazing tool, there are multiple ethical issues with
AI in organizational settings. To start off, there is the ethical questions of
depreciating creators’ creativity and impersonation. Deepfakes have been
developed with AI and essentially take a real humans face to make videos and
images impersonating them. It is ethically incorrect for people to take someone’s
identity without asking. These images and videos can be seen by the public
without informing the audience that it is a deepfake. Since AI is following
patterns, it can follow a pattern to the extreme and almost plagiarize someone’s
content. This may also fall into copy right laws which may cause an organization
legal issues that they were not anticipating. These are the legal and ethical issues
simply based on the content that is created by AI. Unfortunately, there are also
concerns on data leaks of the AI network. Once data has been input into the
network, the AI keeps it to keep analyzing and building patterns. There is also
concern that users can feed the network biased information. This can cause for the
AI tool to produce inaccurate information, this would be ethically incorrect if
users are willingly providing biased information. We might see this when we
attempt to generate a photo of a “CEO” and people only purposely provide data to
generate one demographic."
731,S0091,3,"a. The story below talks about how a person applied to a job but was accused of
“cheating” with the usage of generative AI. After reading the story, I could
conclude that using generative AI in the application of an organizational setting
seems to have a really negative stigma. However, the man did not use
generative AI from the start, the fact that the man was met with a lot of hostility
with the potential usage of generative AI proves that in an organization setting,

ethically it would not prove a positive impact on the application process while
trying to secure a position. The fact that “cheating” was somewhat associated
with AI in this post could further support that potentially utilizing generative AI in a
work setting could lead to negative implications.
b. Another posting I looked into below, is a thread revolving the question, “Is it
morally inethical to ChatGPT to help create your company documentation /
improve scripts / solve basic issues”. This person is inquiring on the ethicality of
ChatGPT in a company. After reading thoroughly through all of the post and
comments, I could conclude that the overall consensus of using generative AI for
work is extremely helpful as a tool."
732,S0092,3,"Generative AI, with its growing prominence in organizational and entertainment sectors, is at the
forefront of legal and ethical concerns. The May Senate hearing involving OpenAI&#39;s CEO Sam
Altman underscored the pressing need for a legislative framework to ensure the safe and ethical
use of AI. Concerns stem from unchecked AI developments–particularly models capable of self-
replication–which, if misused, could bring about unforeseen consequences. This legislative void
becomes even more apparent in the global context, with the EU and China surging ahead with AI
regulations while the U.S. struggles to catch up. Intellectual property rights emerge as another
legal battleground, as AI&#39;s ability to mimic or reproduce original content challenges traditional
concepts of copyright. The music industry, for instance, is wrestling with the balance between
innovation and rightful compensation for artists in the face of AI-generated tracks. Concurrently,
the entertainment industry&#39;s pivot to generative AI, accelerated by the Hollywood writer’s strike,
has thrown a segment of the labor market into flux. Writers might be significantly impacted, with
their roles being altered or potentially replaced entirely. This rapid shift revolves not only around
job dynamics but delves deeper into the creative essence. The advent of AI-generated movies,
while technologically revolutionary, poses profound questions about originality and artistic merit.
The ethical dilemma deepens with the rise of deepfakes—AI-generated replicas of real-life actors.
Beyond the obvious monetary implications for the acting community, these synthetic creations
raise a number of ethical questions. They bypass the human intricacies of consent, age, and
fatigue, and when leveraged for targeted advertising, they risk manipulation on a grand scale. In
summary, generative AI presents complex challenges in terms of regulation, labor market
impacts, intellectual property, and overall ethical use."
733,S0093,3,"I think that there are many issues that come with generative AI. First of all, there is a
chance that generative AI may not always be correct depending on where the platform is pulling
the information from. There is also the possibility of security threats. When a user logs into a
Generative AI, the platform has the ability to take the information it was given and could give it
to someone else. Generative AI having my private information would be a huge privacy concern
for me. Before learning about AI, I was honestly quite scared of it. Now that I have learned
more, my nerves are a little more at ease, but you honestly never know where your information is
going when you log into a Generated AI platform. There are also many ethical issues that come
with a user utilizing Generative AI. With Generative AI, a business is able to collect data and
publish it to their customers. This would be unethical due to the fact that the business did not
actually collect the data and it was created by a program."
734,S0094,3,"According to a reddit post, there is a lot of legal and ethical issues associated with generative AI
from copyrights, intellectual property, and creativity. Coming from an organizational stand
point you do not want to get caught up in any copyright cases because that starts up a whole
new problem for your organization. It could literally cost your organization if it’s that bad
because of AI. Generative AI uses its previous data that it collected so it might be a gray area in
copyrights situation. According to Joren Verspeurt, the author of the article of the link shown
below, there are some high profile lawsuits against AI, which corresponds to some intellectual
property issues. The outcome to these lawsuits pretty much determines if there will be
problems with using generative AI for an organizational setting. The organization could be
accused of copyright infringement because the work of the artist that the AI used to generate
the image. As for ethical issues associated with generative AI it could be that real artist that
took hours and days to do their work. People who put a lot of effort into them are just getting
their work stolen from them. Artists are now just some training aids for the AI. This could create
some backlash for the company because people could be on board with defending the real
artist and not liking AI just stealing their work. Could potentially be bad publicity for the
organization, also a bad look with cancel culture around now days."
735,S0095,3,"Some of the legal issues associated
with generative AI in an organizational
setting include data privacy, biased
data, and the potential for misuse of
AI-generated content. When it comes
to data privacy, whose data is the
generative AI using? That's why
there's an emergence of disputes
regarding copyright infringement.
Organizations have to be thorough in
where they get their information to make sure it's used with proper authorization. Another aspect
regarding data privacy is that since generative AI relies on large datasets, which include not only public
data but also personal and sensitive information, organizations have to have appropriate consent
mechanisms in place to regulate this type of personal data. With regards to biased data, since generative
AI uses existing data, this would include biased and prejudiced data containing discriminatory materials,
so organizations have to monitor this type of behavior in generative AI to ensure the output includes
fairness. Last but not least is the potential misuse of AI-generated content, since AI often creates realistic
content like deepfake AI or even fake articles, it's up to the user to be responsible for the AI-generated
content and the possible exploitation of this kind of technology for harmful purposes. Organizations
should establish guidelines on how generative AI is/will be used within their company. A personal
experience I have with deepfake AI is when I saw a video of former President Obama speaking using
AI-generated voice, the whole video was AI-generated but it seemed so real. People were commenting on
how something like this can raise an issue over the national dispute because what if someone has
malicious intentions and sends it somewhere where it's not supposed to go, and they think it's real?"
736,S0096,3,"Legal and ethical issues associated with generative AI include intellectual property, model bias
in AI-generated content, and data privacy. When creating content through generative AI it is
important for organizations to pay attention to the rights of the content produced and follow the
correct processes if applying for a patent, copyright, trademark, etc. Content generated through
generative AI is subject to ownership and can be considered the intellectual property of the
organization using it.
Model bias is a concern because the information and data learned by generative AI can
sometimes contain bias and stereotypes which produce heavily biased results. AI’s text-to-image
model can be based on stereotypes about race and gender along with other predictions or
classifications that significantly affect the content created. If an organization solely relies on
generative AI without human involvement to produce content, they are bound to encounter some
issues related to bias. Bias can lead to misleading or offensive content that is not beneficial to
anyone.
Data privacy is another major concern in generative AI because the data learned by artificial
intelligence can sometimes be personal. Organizations must navigate regulations and ensure data
protection if they use personal data that puts customers or users of their product/service at risk."
737,S0097,3,"Generative AI has to train itself with a mass amount of data in order to produce original
content. One of the issues with this process is that the data could be inaccurate or biased,
influencing the content that Generative AI produces. This could affect the way the business
enacts its practices. I also previously stated that AI can be used to do other tasks, leaving
employees to be more productive with other tasks. This concept of substitution for tasks could
incentivize organizations and businesses to rely on specific jobs and tasks to AI, effectively
replacing employees. There is also the question of copywriting with specific contents. The
question of copyright ownership is ambiguous when it comes to AI original content, as it is the
AI itself, rather than the company using it, that made the content. Adding upon that, there is a
risk that the Generative AI might accidentally plagiarize or copy other works from previous data.
Situations like these can be seen in the common disputes and complaints between AI generated
art with real artists. Overall, these issues can be fixed by monitoring the Generative AI, from
reviewing what type of data it uses and produces and being legally educated and abiding on the
restrictions of AI generated content."
738,S0098,3,"As with any technological innovation there are always going to be legal and ethical issues
associated. Some of the biggest concerns that come to mind are manipulation, impact on
decision making, copyright and intellectual property issues, and so on. Considering this is
such a new innovation the legal aspect of it is difficult to gauge. It is going to be a long
time until there are laws and regulations set up to fully encompass generative AI in the

business world. I do think the ethical concerns are more prevalent and easily identifiable,
however. A benefit of AI is how easily it can cater to each individual person, but this can
also lead to harmful effects. When a person interacts with a source of information that
built around them uniquely then they are limiting themselves from exposure to other
diverse perspectives. AI can be so advanced that it has the potential to trick users into
thinking they are interacting with a real human. This can lead to confusion about what the
service they are interacting with is. The overestimation of the capabilities of AI is
dangerous because it can lead to people developing a dependence on the entity that is like
that of a real person. This is harmful because the AI can have negative influence over
people who believe the AI is helping them or has their best interest at heart which is
simply not the case."
739,S0099,3,"Generative AI raises various legal and ethical concerns, including issues related to intellectual
property and copyright. Disputes can emerge over the rightful ownership of content generated
by AI. For instance, if I employ ChatGPT to create something, the question of whether Google or
I own the generated content can be a source of significant contention.
Privacy also emerges as a prominent issue. AI actively learns and stores data from the
information it processes, potentially leading to concerns about data usage for marketing
purposes and beyond. Additionally, AI systems can exhibit bias, depending on their training
data and methods, which raises concerns about fairness.
There have been notable instances where AI has been exploited to produce misinformation and
fake news, as shown by the recent case of an AI-generated mugshot of Donald Trump, which
was initially mistaken for a genuine image and aired on news channels before the real mug shot
was revealed.
Another significant concern is the potential displacement of jobs, as AI has the capacity to
automate tasks currently performed by humans. Also, a noteworthy implication is the absence
of empathy and emotional understanding in AI-generated content. Some of the material it
generates can be perceived as offensive or culturally insensitive, underlining the importance of
considering cultural context when deploying AI in diverse settings."
740,S0100,3,"I asked ChatGPT again about the legal and ethical considerations with generative AI to
understand AI’s take on legal and ethical considerations. I was given eight considerations these
being intellectual property and copyright, bias and fairness, privacy, accountability and
responsibility, transparency and explainability, misinformation and manipulation, job
displacement, and security and liability. Upon first look, a lot of these considerations are trying
to be prevented in the rules ChatGPT has in place. Issues such as job displacement are a huge
consideration as we talked about earlier in question two AI is a tool to help employees it might
take over those employee&#39;s jobs completely. As I follow a person on Instagram who recently lost
their job to AI. She used to work as a graphic designer but with the creation of AI art her job was
replaced by AI and now, she works as a waitress. Another issue that is common to see, especially
in the college setting now, is the use of ChatGPT to create essays for students. This can lead to
plagiarism and copyright laws and ethical considerations being broken and causing disciplinary
actions to be taken against those students. The use of AI is not secure either which can lead to
data breaches and problems with security which means a company that uses AI can have all their
customer&#39;s information leaked or even the company’s information leaked."
741,S0101,3,"A key challenge when applying generative AI to a new concept is making sure that it is
sustainable enough to solve any of the issues that may arise."
742,S0102,3,"In organizational settings, generative AI, which includes models of language like GPT-3
and GPT-4, may raise a number of moral and legal concerns. These problems still need
careful thought, and they are changing. Among the principal worries are:
1. Intellectual property: Companies using generative AI might have to answer
issues regarding who owns the content that is produced. Who holds the
copyright to content created by an AI model, for instance, if it produces writing
or artistic output? When AI-generated content is used for profit, this can be
especially difficult.
2. Plagiarism and Copyright Violations: AI-generated content may unintentionally
imitate or closely resemble works that are already published. To prevent
copyright violations and plagiarism, which could result in legal repercussions,
organizations must exercise caution.3. Data security: Generative AI models are frequently trained on huge datasets that
may contain sensitive or private data. Organizations must make sure that the
usage of AI conforms with data privacy laws, such as GDPR or CCPA, and that
no personal information is unintentionally generated or shared.
4. Fairness: Generative AI models have the potential to learn biases from the
training data, which could result in the creation of biased or discriminating
material. The use of AI to produce biased information against specific groups
might result in moral and legal issues, including discrimination lawsuits."
743,S0103,3,"Although utilizing generative AI can bring many benefits to users, it can also bring risks include biased and false information, copyright and intellectual property issues, and data privacy violations. Some of the data can consist of biased information which means incorrect information. With every organization comes lawyers that can protect them from giving wrong information for customers. Based on Reddit user answer, “This year, a lawyer used a fake case in a trial because a legal researcher from their team had used ChatGPT for preparation on the research for the case”. Plagiarism is an important matter to take into consideration as well, because it can promote legal issues. So businesses should take ownership of their data to prevent problems like that. AI depends on massive datasets from consumers so that is why data and privacy can help protect personal information shared. As one user expressed as well, “The utilization of someone's likeness and image without their consent and any compensation raises a variety of legal and ethical concerns, not to mention the job instability that it causes, which leads to greater economic instability”."
744,S0104,3,"When it comes to the legality and ethical dilemma of AI usage, the line becomes a bit blurrier with each practical application. For example, one of the pros of generative AI is its use as a muse for artists, but the flipside of that would be making room for plagiarism. An individual may claim generated art as his or her own work for financial profits. That would be illegal and unethical. A second issue revolves around letting go dedicated employees and replacing them with robots or machines. Is that ethically and morally justifiable? And to top it off, one belief is seen from time and time again, underlying many posts in this Reddit thread: what about ulterior motives that go unseen? Many worry about the individuals manipulating the technology, rather than the generative AI by itself. Not all individuals act as supporters, many want the exact opposite and have malice festering within themselves. How can we monitor usage and make sure to mitigate exploitation? In the end, it’s about company culture and management, and if the workplace allows for it, it is not only hard to manage but virtually impossible to stop such corrupted use of AI. And so, even though AI implementation can change a field for the better, it has the potential of doing much worse. "
745,S0105,3,"The most commonly heard issue associated with legal and ethical problems in regards to AI that
I’ve heard of is job displacement. AI poses a problem when it comes to employment because if it
becomes more common that we implement these AI systems that can perform tasks the everyday
human performs at work, there will slowly be less and less need for human employment.
Another issue would be liability, while these systems are built to function based off of certain
models, that doesn’t mean there isn’t a possibility of accidents. There is a possibility that AI
could cause harm to individuals and turn into a big legal issue, especially depending on what the
specific damage may be. It is stated that another issue could be plagiarism and copyright issues,
which is not something that occurred to me. Systems can’t always be perfect so the likelihood of
a copyright issue happening especially when AI generates items based off of existing patterns
and inputs, something could be similarly replicated."
746,S0106,3,"When speaking about legal and ethical issues associated with generative AI, I think the
most dangerous thing in an organizational setting is the creation of deep fakes. To define,
a deep fake is the manipulation of facial appearances through generative methods. An
organization can utilize a deep fake for a commercial, and this could be grounds for a
lawsuit, due to false advertising, no authorization/permission from the performer, and a
lack of payment. For example, Tom Hanks recently had his face used in a dental
commercial, that was not actually his face. They used a deepfake in order to come up
with the identical copy of Hanks. I think there are also some very sinister implications
due to the rise of deepfakes. It is potentially life-ruining, as you could put somebody’s
face in an inappropriate video, such pornography, and ruin their professional career. It is
very scary as generative AI is continuing to learn, and is imitating people much easier, asseen in the Tom Hanks dental advert. I do worry about non-visual deep fakes, as these
can also be used to falsely accuse an individual of a crime. I think of politicians and their
voices being used to create fake scandals, like a smear campaign. I think the technology
needs to be regulated, and if it isn’t, it has the potential to destroy lives."
747,S0107,3,"Generative AI in organizational settings raises significant legal and ethical concerns. One primary issue is intellectual property rights. Determining the rightful ownership of content or inventions created by AI can prove to be quite complicated, leading to potential legal disputes and a need for clear regulations. Ethically, the risk of AI perpetuating biases from training data is a major concern. If AI is trained on biased historical data, it may cause discrimination in hiring or even customer interactions. Ensuring fairness and transparency in AI algorithms is crucial. The potential job displacement that comes with AI taking on more tasks poses even more ethical dilemmas for organizations. It is necessary that there is a balance between the level of efficiency gains with responsible AI usage. Companies must address these issues proactively in practice. Clear guidelines and regulations should be the defining factor in determining ownership of AI-generated content. Organizations can also offer training and opportunities elsewhere for employees that are affected by AI implementation, avoiding layoffs and maintaining a good reputation. Overall, the legal and ethical issues that come about from using generative AI in organizational settings is a matter of serious concern. However, with clear guidelines, regulations, policies, and overall responsible use, generative AI can prove to be extremely beneficial for an organization."
748,S0108,3,"For as many benefits and utilities generative artificial intelligences could bring, it could bring just as many legal and ethic concerns. There seems to be more ethic concerns then legal ones, but maybe the legal ones aren’t as apparent yet. One of the possible legal concerns is what if a program is input with human created content, and replicates something of its own, is that plagiarism? 
There seem to be a lot more ethical concerns when it comes to generative artifical intelligences however. Like the picture above talks about, a lot of questions regarding job security are important in the development of this artificial intelligence. Aside from ethical questions regarding job security, there are also ethical questions with writing creative things. If a computer program wrote it, does it means as much, and if it portrays things in certain ways is it prejudice? Plus the whole question of using fake actors, theres got to be ethical questions there. Are we making things less enjoyable for people even if it costs less money. Overall, there are a ton of ethical and legal questions surrounding these generative artificial intelligence developments and they should be address quickly as they arise. If a development happens and the ethical and legal issues aren’t met, that can cause for even more issues.
"
749,S0109,3,"There are quite a few legal and ethical issues associated with generative AI in organizational settings. First  output from generative AI could still be copyrighted or intellectual property. It has been found in some instances that images generated are exact copies of elements found in its training images, used to train the generative AI. For this reason it may be best to use generated images as a foundation and not your final result. An ethical concern to using generative AI is the job security or joblessness of the use of this innovative technology.  With replacing jobs that rely on creativity, like writers or illustrators, this could lead to layoffs or unemployment and eventually economic instability. In more extreme cases, generative AI could cause a mass amount of displaced workers whose jobs are highly automatable. Another major ethical concern is the use of generative AI for making deepfakes. Deepfakes are videos or audios that look and sound like people in the real world. This could cause issues with misinformation because you could be spreading fake news. This could cause fraud because deepfakes are pretending to be someone else. This could also be a security concern because  fake images or videos of real people could be used as blackmail.

"
750,S0110,3,Some of the legal and ethical issues associated with Generative AI can be privacy issues because it does require a lot of data and it can be personal information. If personal information gets released without approval and is used it can cause legal issues. There are also concerns with identity theft. There can also be issues with security concerns as hackers or cyber-attacks can disrupt and leak information gathered by the generative AI. There can also be issues in the work force for companies using AI in at jobs. Companies must make sure that employees are using AI correctly and abiding by legal rules. If rules are broken it can put companies in danger of lawsuits and potentially losing money or credibility for wrongful use of AI. Generative AI can make mistakes even though it is calculated it is possible for the Generative AI to cause harm or mistakes to others.

752,S0112,3,"Expanding off the example of art creation, generative AI is at the center of a hot debate in the acting and creative artist communities. If an organization can use AI software to create a video, an artwork, or any piece of media in the style of a human artist, it should be greatly considered if the original artists legal and ethical right are being infringed upon. 
Thank to the OpenAI subreddit, I learned about an interesting precedent on a singer’s rights to the sound of their voice. In this scenario, Ford hired an impersonator and purposely sought to capitalize on consumers’ familiarity with the sound of Midler’s voice. However, what may prove interesting is when a generative AI tool creates a piece of content that maintains a likeness to another artist, not because of the intentional direction of the prompt to copy that artist, but the unintentional end result bearing a resemblance because the AI tool drew on an original creator’s original content as refernence and ultimately created something in the same style. Just like musicians who create songs with similar beats, albeit unintentional, respect should still be paid to the original artist. Howver the age old question issue of how long can humans create original content, or we’ll eventually run out of things no one’s though of before, is a real consideration too. Especially as the speed in which content is created is amplified by generative AI tools.
"
753,S0113,3,"There  are a lot of  things  that need to be considered when taking on the ethical and legal nature of AI. The first thing people often think when they hear AI is  “unfair”. By what we often  consider fair in society they are correct. It feels wrong to have a student spend hours of time researching and writing a paper only for his peer to generate it in a few moments and receive the same grade. The fact is that this is a part of life and our future so we are going to have to change what we consider fair. As mentioned by the Quora user below, transparency could be an issue. People could so easily take AIs information and pass it off as their own. I’m not sure what rules will come regarding this issue but I’m sure some will come in place soon. Another major issue is security. There will need to be more security to make sure that AI does not access confidential information. Its database if not accurately secured could be hacked which could  be detrimental to a company. "
754,S0114,3,"This question and post led to an excellent blog post which I have hyperlinked after the image. 
The big ethical question with Generative AI currently is its use of art and content created by 
humans in the first place. Since it must derive its own creations from something, often what 
happens is we have results in the technology that produce remarkably similar looking work to 
what can be found on the internet. Because of this, we end up having some massive, uneasy 
ethical questions about where in this process can it be considered plagiarism. You also have 
issues with the fact that legally, this technology is so new that there hasn’t been much law or 
precedent set to fully describe what is legal and illegal use according to copyright. Ownership 
becomes a hot-button issue with this subject since it starts to blur the lines between what is 
owned and what isn’t. Is the work, derivative of the original art, still considered original? What 
about artist compensation for Gen AI images? Should this technology even be used in the first 
place if it’s going to cause so many ethical and legal questions?  
 "
755,S0115,3,"Some legal issues associated with generative AI can range from copyright, intellectual property, and mistake creativity. Using both in and out sourced information, it can be hard to determine what is 100% unique, and what is not. It is possible to mistake direct copies of other content as uniquely created by AI. It is important to check similar sources and Input your own thoughts into content you receive from an AI source, to ensure there is no copyright in the work you present. Staying ethical. 
"
756,S0116,3,"	Within organizational settings, generative AI has seen some very high morale conflicts that suggest a potential future threat to society. A prime example of this is the use of deepfakes and voice changers which allow any human to match or create movements and apply anyone’s face to it as if the person they included was the one speaking. Pairing the deepfake up with the voice changer AI allows for you to take voice samples and add a specific voice that was taken from video samples around the world and developed into a realistic end result. This way of using generative AI allows for its creators to write up ideas for their planned proposals and fake what they are doing as legitimate. There are plenty of examples where people have used this to scam random people online and steal information which has led to copyright issues and lawsuits. These methods are effective and can be used for good by businesses to cut costs; however, there is immediate backlash when the AI generation is revealed. An example of this was when Disney had a show introduction in which they used AI to generate it, which ultimately led to major criticism as it was clearly intended to be used as a cost cut more than anything which can be seen as unethical in taking jobs away from talented individuals."
757,S0117,3,"One of the major issues with Generative AI has been the sourcing of the generations. When stable diffusion and other generative AI were being regularly used by people on the internet it was found that the AI's sources were using people's art, and it caused an uproar with the question of generative AI being theft of art. It didn't stop there generative AI that was used in the field of using people's voices caused uproar from voice actors as they felt their voice were being stolen. Because of the question of what is being fed into the AI being other people's original works and the rights associated with those works there becomes a gray area in the legal and ethical departments. Sure, the content created by the AI can be considered ""original"" however what if the source used was another person's work? Is that new generated content truly original anymore and could fall out of the laws of fair use. Also say content is not protected by copyright you then fall under the moral ramifications of new content being produced as the argument could be made that the new content stole from other people's original work."
758,S0118,3,"Generative AI in organizational settings presents several legal and ethical challenges that organizations need to address. Generative AI can potentially produce content that infringes upon copyrights or plagiarized existing work. Organizations must ensure that AI generated content does not violate intellectual property laws. Ownership can be complex in these kinds of situations. Organizations should establish clear policies on intellectual property rights related to AI generated work. When generative AI uses data to train and generate content, organizations must ensure that they handle data responsibly, respecting individuals privacy rights. AI models can be vulnerable to attacks and organizations should implement security measures to protect AI systems and the data they use from breaches or manipulation. Another thing that AI will have issues with is biases and fairness. Generative AI models can inherit biases present in the training data, potentially leading to biased content. Organizations should be aware of these biases and work to mitigate them. Ensuring that AI generated content is fair and unbiased particularly in areas like hiring or customer service, is essential to avoid discrimination. AI might also have issues with things like transparency and accountability. Generative AI models can be highly complex which makes it challenging to understand how they arrive at their decisions or generate content. Organizations must thrive for transparency and explainability to build trust. "

760,S0120,3,"When we dive into the legal and ethical side of AI, there are some important points to consider.
Firstly, AI can sometimes generate content that might violate copyright or intellectual property
laws, so companies need to be cautious about what they let AI create. Secondly, AI can absorb
biases from its training data, leading to unfair outcomes, especially in fields like hiring or
customer service, which brings up concerns about fairness. Thirdly, AI often deals with sensitive
personal data, like your personal information. If it's not handled properly, it could pose privacy
issues, especially concerning regulations like GDPR. Fourthly, understanding how AI makes
decisions can be challenging, making it difficult to pinpoint accountability, particularly in crucial
areas like loans or medical decisions. Hence, organizations should be transparent about how their
AI functions. Fifthly, AI has the potential to generate problematic content like deepfake videos or
fake news. Lastly, as AI takes on tasks, it might lead to job displacement for some people.
Companies need to think about how to address these changes, such as providing training or
finding new roles for affected employees."
761,S0121,3,"The main legal and ethical issues associated with generative AI is should the AI’s content be looked at in the same way as a human? AI has the capability to create music or other art similar to a human and that brings up the issue of copyright. Some argue that AI should not be able to make profit or copyright a song since a human brain did not create it. Others argue that it is allowed and that without humans using the AI, the song would have never been created. In addition, will there be bias and fairness in using the generative AI. It is not fair if someone is using AI to generate all of their work compared to someone actually performing it which can lead to organizational challenges."
762,S0122,3,"Issues with generative AI may be that it is currently and may always be misleading or factually incorrect. Before using even this free source ChatGPT, one of the main bullet points before using it was that the answer it gives may be incorrect. Although I did say I could not replicate that issue, I believe it to be true and if we are to incorporate this kind of innovative technology into the workplace, it must be correct all the time. Another issue would be the jobs lost when AI is fully incorporated into the workplace. I think there will be some who do not adjust with the times and retrain for AI and will lose their jobs. But for the majority, I think AI will help with efficiency and quality of life by replacing these staffed jobs with AI automation. Another issue could be biases with the AI, because whoever designs these programs could inject their own biases into the data it pulls or the responses it gives. So, I think it would be possible for someone to program bias into the AI like politics, company information, suggesting of a certain service, ideologies, maybe even religion, whatever question asked could be suggested one way or the other based on the owner and programmer of the AI."
763,S0123,3,"There are various legal and ethical issues associated with generative AI in organizational settings. The main one I can think of is intellectual property and copyright. I have seen this issue occur a lot in recent times due to the rapidly increasing popularity of AI generated art. Artists are finding their art being stolen by this AI and it has created ownership issues. Just like the OP mentioned in their post, while graphic designers and web designers can use the technology for their own benefit, there comes a problem with determining authorship and ownership which can become complex once AI is involved. Another big issue with generative AI is job displacement. We know there are many new job opportunities available with AI but there can be just as many jobs lost through AI. Imagine you work hard for 10+ years and are told how much you are valued within a company only to be fired the next day because they can use generative AI instead. Bias and discrimination is another issue that can come from generative AI like Chat GPT. When presenting training data these generative AI models can show biases that will result in biased content generation, hiring processes, or even decision-making. It is important to validate any information given through these models to avoid any bias or discrimination."

Does the organization own it, does the organization who created the AI own it, or does the AI itself own it? I feel that the main ethical issues would revolve around bias and privacy. Since generative AI uses datasets, there is a possibility for some of that data to be biased or discriminatory. There is also a possibility of the AI to generate private information through all of the data they use. "
766,S0126,3,"The legal and ethical issues of AI are as wide and varied as the ethical issues of people. As long as people have the potential to be unethical, or break the law, AI will also have that potential. AI is not so much dangerous in and of itself, as much as the people using AI can use it for dangerous purposes. Currently, laws surrounding AI are in their infancy, much like the field of AI, so the most important thing for individuals to remember when utilizing AI is to be ethical themselves. We as a species should not be giving important tasks like strategic warfare decisions or even autonomous driving to AI because human lives have come into the equation. An AI making a mistake on a shipping label produces a minor annoyance for the employees who have to fix the issue and the customer who must wait longer, but on the scale of vehicles, or even warfare, a mistake from the AI could be fatal. AI should be limited and require human input for it to function so that errors don't go unnoticed and the AI doesn't make critical mistakes without a human to review."
767,S0127,3,"One of the main legal issues with generative AI is copyright. Most the content this technology creates is developed from already existing works. It could violate the property rights of the original creator because the content that comes could only look slightly different. Also ethically, the line between what is human and what is machine made is becoming more thin because it's hard to tell the difference. This could impact businesses and artists because many customers want transparency and need to trust their product/service, etc. Obviously, this could also be used for malice and unethical purpose. I've seen deepfake videos of people doing explicit activities and political propaganda videos and this is super terrible and detrimental for that person. "
768,S0128,3,"Some legal and ethical issues associated with AI include artwork and artists' rendering. AI can reproduce near-perfect images at the drop of a hat and steal its likeness. Additionally, it can mimic that artist's style. Many IP-related issues broach the line of copyright infringement. I suspect many cases will be brought to the Supreme Court level in the next 10-20 years and the current court is ill-equipped to deal with such cases. Generative models can also imitate celebrities and real-life people who are often indistinguishable from the original. This could create political issues. For instance, if someone created a political ad using a model that looked like the current or former president."
769,S0129,3,"There are many legal and  ethical issues associated with generative AI in an organizational setting. As stated in the previous questions many individuals believe that AI will make their line of work obsolete. Instead of looking at things in that way, we can team up with generative AI to our advantage and have it work for us. For example If you were to team up with generative AI it could focus on parts of the projects that may be a weakness to you. Then you would tackle all of your strengths and in turn you would produce a very well executed problem. In another example we have done some learning through AI this semester and it has sparked a lightbulb in my thought process. The generative AI is being used to free up so much time for the professor and he uses AI to help him instead of being afraid that it will one day take over and he will lose his job. There will also be other legal and ethical issues for generative AI. For instance, say someone hacks one of these generative AI machines and steals valuable information from a company and posts it or takes control of the generative AI machines.

771,S0131,3,"When it comes to legal and ethical issues associated with generative AI, it becomes a
slippery slope because there are many things to consider. When it comes to the legal
aspect of these issues I think that you need to dig deep into technicalities because the
main issue is mimicking certain things or being very similar but not the exact same
thing. With AI and generative AI gaining lots of popularity, it becomes very hard to
establish the original source that the AI is gaining its information from. Another issue
that has been expressed with generative AI is data privacy. Generative AI requires a lot
of different type of information and so the main concern with this is if there is some sort
of hacking involved or leak. When it comes to the terms of ethics, public and individual
opinions are involved. A big issue with ethics is biases, fairness, unfair advantages etc.
Another concern is with the information it is outputting. Although the information is pretty
accurate, there may be faults. With all of these concerns it goes back to the very
beginning and how it is tailored and the restrictions that are put into the system.

Here are the most frequent points of legal and ethical concerns that I found: some users say that generative AI can be used in an irresponsible or non-transparent way. People can use this as their final work rather than an inspiration, essentially cheating at their task or stealing information which can be both illegal and unethical. In addition, generative AI seems to give people the idea that people will lose their jobs. This idea was a crucial part of the subreddit with some users saying that it is very unethical while others claim that this is just something that happens throughout history whenever a new innovation hits the scene. Some people believe that it is possible to reinvent yourself and find a new job while others claim this is still unethical. I believe that both are true, but it can still be considered unethical because of this.

Offensive cyberattacks include a breach in data privacy within organizations. For example, many guests were concerned following the cyberattack of MGM, and their main concern being whether or not guest information was leaked during the attack.

They are upset that their life’s work and creativity is being given to a machine which will use their human skills to create and write in their voices without any compensation or acknowledgement. This leads to an ethical discussion of privacy and fair data collection. Many businesses and organizations hold proprietary information and data collected about their customers or employees. If all of this given to AI, how do we guarantee safety and privacy? Could generative AI be fed misinformation and, in turn, deliver or create biased or unethical content? Also, since AI and generative AI is so new there are not many laws that can be used to protect someone with these types of privacy or predatory data concerns. Another organization that is grappling with how to ethically deal with AI is the education realm. Are students really learning if they are asking ChatGPT to help with all their homework questions?

775,S0135,3,"From what I have gathered in the Quora Space, generative AI usage in organizations sparks many legal and ethical concerns. Legally, strict adherence to data protection rules and intellectual property regulations becomes pivotal. Organizations must ensure that their employment of generative AI avoids unwittingly infringing upon copyrights and intellectual property rights. This involves the continuous monitoring of AI generated content to detect potential violations and the implementation of corrective actions when necessary. When it comes to ethics, our attention turns to issues like privacy, bias, and transparency. Ensuring the privacy of data, especially when dealing with sensitive information, becomes a top priority. Generative AI tends to carry forward biases from the data it's trained on, highlighting the importance of careful monitoring and strategies to counteract bias. Transparency plays a crucial role in building and preserving trust, urging organizations to be open about AI's functions and limitations. Even though it's debated whether it can produce entirely original thoughts, it does have its constraints. These systems depend on pre-existing data to create content. Nonetheless, it seems that their capacity to blend and reinterpret information can still result in valuable insights and fresh solutions"

When generative AI uses personal data to generate content, it raises privacy concerns. Organizations must adhere to data protection regulations and anonymize data as needed. Data privacy is a huge issue correlated with AI. All our information is constantly getting gathered and pooled together, regardless of whether we like it or not. Ethical issues include job displacement, consent, and fairness. There may be bias incorporated in training the data, which can be misleading in certain situations. The advancement of AI means that human jobs are becoming less needed. Manual work is not always as sharp as AI, which leads to job displacement, because they are not needed. AI might do everything a human can do and more, which is a huge controversy regarding the ethical aspect in organizational settings. Also, many times our data is being used and tracked, without us even being fully aware of it. Legal and ethical concerns include data privacy, intellectual property, and bias in AI-generated content. Organizations must navigate regulations, ensure data protection, and address AI-generated content that may be misleading or offensive. AI has many advantages, but it definitely raises eyebrows when it comes to the legal and ethical side of it."

778,S0138,3,"There are many legal and ethical issues associated with generative AI in organizational settings.
One risk involves bias and false information due to the system learning from the wrong source.
Certain prompts can lead to sexual, hateful, violent, or harmful content despite filters and
attempts to mitigate them as much as possible. This false information could lead to even more
polarization and turn people against each other unwillingly. This could also lead to more
discrimination and inequality in the workplace, which is why it is so important that generative AI
is trained on unbiased and diverse data. For example, this year, a lawyer used ChatGPT in a trial
and ended up citing a case that had never existed. This had tremendous implications because the
legal research was completely false. This is why the continuous training and testing of the
technology is incredibly important. There are also a variety of copyright and intellectual property
issues which have been represented by recent lawsuits. Data privacy is another issue. For
instance, generative AI in entertainment could eventually lead to the utilization of deepfakes by
studios. This not only leads to job displacement and economic instability, but it also raises a
variety of legal and ethical concerns regarding the use of someone's likeness without their
consent and without any compensation."
779,S0139,3,"While Ai-generated data and photos technically are not copyrighted, the possibility for legal issues is still present. Generative AI can inadvertently generate content that closely resembles existing copyrighted material, potentially leading to accusations of plagiarism or copyright infringement. Generative AI often relies on large datasets, which may contain sensitive or personal information. Organizations must ensure that data used for training and operation of AI models is handled in compliance with data privacy regulations, such as HIPAA. Ethics can also determine the usefulness of AI too. For example, chatbots and customer service bots are replacing the need for a human job. Many people on Reddit seemed very concerned about that. "
780,S0140,3,"Even though artificial intelligence technology is innovative and can facilitate business 
effectively, there are also legal and ethical concerns. Rehan explains that intellectual property 
rights, liability and accountability are at risk of being legal allegations as AI technology becomes 
more popular amongst its users. Questioning where the information comes from and who owns it 
are really great questions that Rehan brings to our attention in the below response. The ethical 
issue is the biased nature of AI due to its pre-programmed algorithm of collecting and analyzing 
large amounts of data. Evidently there’s no emotion or consciousness on what is generated 
through AI that the merged information can unintentionally discriminate against the opposing 
party. It’s very appealing to know that Rehan shared his personal experience with AI at his 
workplace and how the legal team needed to get involved to avoid any lawsuits. Instead of 
eliminating jobs, he created a specialty team who oversaw any biases generated from the AI 
system they were using. He believes that AI technology is effective and resourceful with careful 
planning, and strategically training employees on how to keep legal and ethical issues controlled. 
As a result, innovation is about being comfortable with the uncomfortable but carefully 
analyzing what can be controlled to mitigate risks of the unknown.  "
781,S0141,3,"3.	I’ve come to notice that no one cares about ethics when it comes to AI. While looking up ethics in the reddit community, there were multiple posts about people trying to figure out loopholes around the AI having “training wheels” essentially. Many different users were upset that the AI had restrictions and were trying to find ways around the restrictions to get the results they wanted. There were multiple different threads about how to set it up so you could bypass them and even more threads of users just complaining that they were there. When I used an AI service and told it to make a racist joke, it immediately said no and there was nothing I could do about it. I feel as if this isn’t hindering the experience of using AI since these are important ethics to understand. And quite frankly, it’s up to the company that creates the AI for which ethical decisions they want to make. So if a user doesn’t like the way the AI is working, they can find a different one. I was astonished to see that Microsoft even fired their ethics team. All of these reactions has a lot to say about our society and the real reason we want to use AI."
782,S0142,3,"With its ability to create content, generative AI has really created a number of legal and ethical considerations for the corporate world. Legal issues with intellectual property are among the main issues. Imagine that your AI develops a novel marketing strategy or a patented invention. Who is the owner of such work or creation? Is it the company that used the AI, the person who made the design adjustments, or the AI itself? This ambiguity necessitates both explicit ownership regulations and the potential for legal disputes.
Morally, we must examine the prospect that AI could reinforce biases found in training data. If your AI is trained with biased historical data, it may unintentionally prejudice against certain groups, whether through hiring procedures or communication with clients. It becomes crucial to maintain fairness and transparency in AI algorithms. The issue of job displacement also exists. As AI takes on more duties, it can result in layoffs and labor force restructuring, causing moral quandaries for businesses. The key to successfully navigating these legal and moral seas is finding the ideal balance between productivity gains and appropriate AI use.
In order to successfully enter the world of generative AI in business setups, it is ultimately all about proactive planning and being aware of the ethical and regulatory frameworks.

"
783,S0143,3,"Generative AI in corporate contexts raises intricate legal and ethical dilemmas that warrant careful examination. Firstly, the thorny issue of Intellectual Property Rights arises. Generative AI's capacity to produce content resembling existing work can lead to potential copyright violations and disputes over intellectual property. It becomes incumbent upon organizations to implement safeguards ensuring that AI-generated content aligns with copyright laws and upholds intellectual property rights. Addressing bias and upholding fairness is a multifaceted ethical challenge. Generative AI, deriving insights from existing data, may unwittingly perpetuate biases embedded in its training data, resulting in the creation of biased content. Organizations need to take proactive steps to confront these biases, conduct routine assessments of AI systems to ensure fairness, and employ strategies to counteract discrimination. Mitigating the dissemination of misinformation and combating deepfakes assumes ethical primacy. Generative AI's ability to craft convincingly deceptive content underscores the need for robust mechanisms to detect and prevent the spread of falsehoods. The issue of job displacement, stemming from AI's transformative impact on employment, is a significant ethical consideration. Companies must exhibit ethical responsibility by offering retraining opportunities and support for employees affected by AI-induced changes in the workplace. AI's role in pivotal decision-making processes, such as recruitment or lending, introduces ethical complexities related to fairness, bias, and accountability. Navigating these multifaceted issues requires the establishment of comprehensive AI governance frameworks, transparent AI processes, strict adherence to legal regulations, and consistent ethical assessments. Collaboration between experts in technology, law, and ethics remains essential for effectively addressing these intricate challenges in organizational settings."
784,S0144,3,"While artificial intelligence promotes increased efficiency in the personal spaces as well as the professional workplace, it can also lead to legal implications and ethical issues in organizational settings. With granted access to information within an organization, there is potential for accidental unauthorized leaks and release of private information. This can include private financial information or personal medical records that may be detrimental for view or use in inappropriate situations."
785,S0145,3,"There are many legal and ethical issues found with generative AI in organizations and the work force of the world. Since AI is a fairly new breakthrough in technology there are still things that are being ironed out, but AI still faces many restrictions. One issue is having generative AI create work that is very similar to the work of another artist. AI can create work that is ""new"" but still copy's the same format and styling of a popular or common artist. This gets in the issue of if the artwork is its own work of art or a trademark infringement of the original creator of the style. Another issue that generative AI gets involved with a lot is the use of someone else's models to create a similar replica of it. An example I found while looking through the Machine Learning forums is that you can use AI to copy the algorithm and search function of google but at that point is the AI's work legal or is it under the work of google who created the original algorithm and search feature. This is a big issue on both the legal standpoint and ethical stand point due to being able to copy a lot of features and programs from other places using AI as its base. "
786,S0146,3,"With generative AI, there are a lot of legal and ethical issues. One of those issues involve biases and false information being spread. When a platform with generative AI learns from biased information, they will generate and distribute false information that can lead to discrimination, inequality, and harmful outcomes. For example, since generative AI can learn from collecting information in forms such as art or photos, it can use that information to create pictures of people that are not real. This can depict people in an unfavorable light and can affect their lives and careers. Another issue that can be faced with generative AI is the possibility of copyright and intellectual properties rights. Since AI learns from what has already been made and created, they can use those datasets to create music using copyrighted beats or create art using an artist’s style. This becomes an issue when the generative AI creates a product that is similar to an artist’s work. This would lead to copyright claims since it would rightfully upset the artist since it takes a person time to create their craft yet it takes AI a quick second to do something similar. "
787,S0147,3,"I think that legally you would need to have regulations against making them sentient. I do not mean that as a way to stop the plot of Terminator or anything like that, but I feel like there is some danger in telling AI to go out and make as much money as possible. It could get to a point where AI duplicates and uses its powers to illegally obtain money from places that should not be accessible. Like if it could crack codes and back ends of the institutions that run our country, they could do incredible damage with that information. There is a duty to make it safe for the general public. There is a world in which the power of these LLMs has total control over the internet and all the sensitive data held on it. It seems extreme but I truly do not trust that there will not be people who use it for large scams and hacks. In an organizational setting, we need to make sure that we do not rely solely on the work of AI. No matter how close AI can get to replacing a lawyer, it simply should not. In my opinion of course."
788,S0148,3,"A legal and/or ethical issue that jumps out to me immediately is the accusation of not 
having originality, or perhaps cheating. Since a corporation would not have a human be doing 
these analyses, it could be seen as foul play. Personally, I disagree with this, since the generative 
AI would be using the business's own content to train itself, but it does raise many eyebrows that 
may result in an interesting court case. There may be accusations that the model is being trained 
with a rival corporation's private information as well. I also foresee issues regarding jobs being 
lost. I mentioned in the previous question that bots could take over customer service jobs. It 
could also take over analytical jobs that deal with numbers. I don't see a total overhaul of human 
jobs, but I see many of them being lost. After all, humans will have to double-check an AI's 
responses and suggestions before a corporation should enact them. It's unwise to trust an AI's 
word as gospel, especially when it means putting your corporation's reputation and income on 
the line. There would also have to be people maintaining these AI and making sure they're 
obtaining the most up-to-date information they can. In a way, this would generate jobs in the 
same way it takes out jobs. Going back to the no-originality accusations, it's feasible to assume 
that corporations could be accused of copyright infringement if their models are trained off 
imagery that they don't have rights to. Since AI doesn't truly make art, rather mashing together 
art it was trained from, I can see this having a case in court."
789,S0149,3,"In an organizational setting, AI has ethical and legal issues attached to it. The biggest
thing that is going around is the fact that AI is going to take over and there will be many
people without jobs. This is an ethical issue because we have to determine if it is okay to
terminate people and get rid of jobs because AI is able to accomplish it. Or is there a
certain number that is okay to lay off? There are also some legal issues as well. There are
certain circumstances that we have to think about. There could be specific instances
where an AI system is trained to do something specific or give out information to
questions asked. In some cases, AI can receive information from the wrong source and
dish out things that are wrong. This can also include words that are offensive to other
people. This could then turn into a lawsuit that is going to be questionable because it is
coming from AI. One of the biggest things would be an AI system going rogue and either
dishing out information or destroying information that could be vital to a company. There
is still a grey area which is why it is important to have humans part of the process."
790,S0150,3,"While AI, can be a helpful tool it can create issues with plagiarism and copyright infringement. AI
can only develop answers or tasks from previous publications others have made. If it was to
develop an answer to a question, it is gathering information that was previously"
791,S0151,3," One of the ethical issues that I’ve seen recently with generative AI is that its use can
undermine the importance and works of those in the entertainment industry, whether its movies,
video games, or shows. These can also be used irresponsibly, especially when
organizations/people pass off AI work as their own or aren’t transparent that they’re using AI.
I’ve particularly seen this in art and issues with voice actors and, as another user wrote, some
companies are becoming increasingly interested/invested in using generative AI to replace
people and their work. Another issue that is both legal and ethical in nature is data privacy of
users as the data being used by generative AI is essentially pulled from our input and that brings
up concerns on whether that’s a breach of privacy or not. Sometimes the content created by
generative AI can be seen as a mimicry of other people's works. One user brought up an
interesting thought in that since the AI is being fed information and can’t really think on the level
of a human (so it can’t really take in any factors like feeling/judgment), biases can be generated
in the data/content that can mislead businesses or can misrepresent information."
792,S0152,3,"Generative AI has the ability to create photos or messages which are not original, it is hard to determine the ownership of the original creator without laws limiting the capabilities of AI. With AI searching through various databases to create their content, there are some concerns of whether or not they are violating certain privacy rights of others by looking through their information. Many companies use AI to sift through resumes in order to pick the candidates which they feel fit all of the criteria the company is looking for. This could raise ethical concerns because these companies might choose certain categories to be eliminated during the selection process, possibly eliminating certain zip codes which are predominantly Hispanic or Black. Since AI has various information from many platforms, it is at risk for cyber-attacks, businesses must implement security services which will prevent attacks. one of the downsides to AI is the fact that it will leave many people out of jobs because of AI. Businesses must take this into consideration and provide other options for affected employees so they will not lose their job. A very big legal issue which is arising with the popularity of AI, fake documents which look real can be created and used to take advantage of people for fraudulent purposes. "
793,S0153,3,"Since AI is a technological tool, the concerns with legal and ethical issues lie mainly in the intent of the designer or creator. Since generative AI is a model that is created by various inputs of data, the designer can intentionally feed the model biased and harmful data to create a work of writing or graphics that is strongly persuasive and seeks to harm a person or a group of people. There is also a question of ownership when it comes to all creations of a generative AI model. If an AI model creates a great advertising campaign or a set of images that are unique and evocative, is the content the property of the company that drove the project, does it belong to the company that owns the AI model, or does it belong to no one at all since the creation was a product of prior works, fed into a learning AI model? There would be reason to fight for that property from all angles in that scenario. The idea that a model can even be fed proprietary data is a question in and of itself. There is debate on whether a model can use works that are created by others at all, especially when seeking a profit. "
794,S0154,3,"There are legal and ethical issues that come up with the use of generative AI. Since generative AI uses data already on the internet then creates something based off of its findings there can be copyright infringement issues with generative AI. For example someone could decide to use generative AI to create a logo for a company they are working on. Possibly without knowing it the image that was created by generative AI could already belong to a company. I have also seen there are some companies that own rights to specific colors like “Target red”, “Barbie Pink”, or “UPS Brown”. If you didn’t know about something like companies owning colors and you used generative AI to create a logo that just so happens to use one of those colors then you could be sued. There are also issues with privacy that can be associated with generative AI. In a previous discussion we watched a video on deep fakes. Deep fakes are videos that feature someone saying or doing something that they did not actually say or do. Deep fakes cause be used on people like celebrities and this would cause them a lot of legal issues. Especially if their image is being used without their knowledge and is being used to promote something they don’t actually promote or are in support of."
795,S0155,3,"Generative AI can be seen as unethical in many aspects. Generative AI is often seen as an easy way out. Schools themselves are against the use of AI and have dire consequences if they find out you used AI. The consequences themselves can result in your expulsion of the institutions, with the argument of students cheating because they don’t do their work using their own words. As a student is understandable for there to be consequences about cheating and using AI. For an organizational or business setting, generative AI is honored. Ai is starting to be seen as a great way to save time and get work done. AI can get rid of the easy and commonly done work that will allow you time to get into the priority work."
796,S0156,3,"The discussion I used to answer this question was focused on AI-generated art, but it illustrated many key debates surrounding the ethical and legal questions aroused by AI. If, for example, Disney or some other movie studio starts using AI to create movies, comic books, and other art, they have to use human artists’ work to train the AI. The issue is that this artwork is indirectly being used by Disney but the original artists would not be compensated. Some people think this is a violation of copyright laws while others consider the AI created work to be original and the works used for training no different than art a human may view for inspiration. The same principle applies to using AI to imitate or replicate someone’s voice and features, which could be used in movies, video games, or advertising for any company. Of course, many artists also fear being completely replaced, which illustrates the larger issue of AI replacing any job. Many of the ethical concerns aroused by the vast amount of data collected on consumers are merely accentuated by advent of AI trained on that data for use in marketing, customer service, or product design. It would clearly be extremely difficult to control or even require disclosure of the data used to train AI. Taxing companies that replace employees with AI or use AI-generated art would also be difficult and, of course, raises another host of questions about government overreach. "
797,S0157,3,"Legal and ethical issues arise with the deployment of generative AI in organizational settings. One major concern is bias. If the training data is biased, the AI outputs may perpetuate and amplify existing biases, leading to unfair practices. Intellectual property concerns emerge when AI generates content that resembles copyrighted materials, raising questions about ownership and copyright infringement. Privacy is another critical issue, especially if generative AI is utilized with personal data, requiring organizations to navigate data protection regulations carefully.

Transparency and accountability pose challenges, as the complex nature of generative AI makes it difficult to explain how it arrives at specific decisions. This lack of transparency can be a hurdle, particularly in sectors with stringent regulations. Organizations must address these legal and ethical considerations to ensure responsible and fair use of generative AI.
"
798,S0158,3,"I believe there are a ton of legal and even more ethical issues that come with generative AI in organizational settings. The top comment from u/Automatic_Memory4818 makes a good point about the effect on the entertainment industry that is already happening. We’ve currently been seeing the Writer’s Strike play out in Hollywood. It is scary to think that a lot of the amazing writer’s we see and have grown to love their work could be potentially replaced with AI. by using generative AI to replace jobs like this, there are issues of deepfakes, proper copyright, de-evaluation of human creativity, (which I think will be noticeable when audiences compare older and newer films) The process of having to balance the rapid innovation we will see with generative AI will be very interesting. Another user, u/juilianapakele mentions how there are possibilities of data leakage as well as the process of ethical data for AI. Depending how the AI is automated, it is very easy for an AI to be biased which can lead to a ton of lawsuits almost all circulating Title VII. The user mentions that organizations and businesses will have to be extremely careful and aware of how the AI is being programmed and possibly have a human who regulates and keeps the AI in line so it doesn’t pick up on undesirable biases. "
799,S0159,3,"There are several legal and ethical issues associated with generative AI in organizational settings.
The more it is being implemented in contemporary society, the more we are able to see these
effects in real time. Most of the ethical issues involved with generative AI is the lack of
government and policy structures to avoid misuse of AI. Because AI lowers the amount of
people needed to oversee certain parts of an organization, there is to be specific and strategic
oversight in the way that generative AI is implemented. For example, Google dissolved its AI
ethics board after one week because of complaints about one member's anti-LGBTQ views and
the fact that another member was the CEO of a drone company whose AI was being used for
military applications. The bias of these high ranked individuals have their ethics put into
question, which shows that there must be clear and direct oversight in generative AI when it
comes to organizational settings. While having a board might be sufficient, there must be many
checks and balances in ensuring that Ai use goes through a series of people that allow a more
close moderation of generative AI and generative AI tools."
800,S0160,3,"Many redditors brought up the issue of privacy when asked about the legal/ethical bounds of AI. There were several users that were upset at the fact that U.S Census data was heavily used in the programing of these systems. Others chimed in that that is what the U.S Census is there for, so that people can view the market of the U.S and that this is know different than a human looking at the census report from their desk and basing their new marketing campaign on it. There were serval of whom brought us the point that new legislation should be passed for this new era of technology, bringing up the fact that we should get ahead of this before we hit things like cyber bullying cases that lead to several teen deaths in the late 90s/early 2000's. There was no legislation in relation to internet crimes at the time and those left a huge gray area for what was and way not acceptable at the time. Currently there are no hard lines for legal/ethical conduct for organizations, the institutions that are trying the hardest to create one at present time are schools and universities."
801,S0161,3,"It appears that there is quite a bit of issues that could arise from generative AI. Organizations could face the system being biased or discriminating. The AI is compiled with so much information and is trained to recognize historical data. If a company is screening job applicants, then they may face a situation of discrimination, because the applicant might not match the history of applicants. “AI systems often operate in a black box.” In this case they could struggle with transparency and accountability. Just like any technology there could be errors. The AI doesn’t always know how they arrived at a decision. There is a huge concern for the privacy aspect of generative AI. With there being large amounts of data, everyone is concerned with how this information will be managed. There are strong possibilities for information being hacked. One of the biggest concerns overall is job displacement. Although this will put lots of people without jobs, on the upside it could provide jobs. It will take time to train and restructure what kind of jobs will be available once AI really starts expanding. Lastly, another concern is with autonomous weapons. “Questions of accountability, the potential for misuse, and the loss of human control over life-and-death decisions.”"

803,S0163,3,"There are a lot of ethical concerns that are associated with generative AI and business. Some of these concerns can even form into legal concerns. I think that there are ethical concerns that are associated with people using generative AI in a business setting. I once had a coworker who was applying to a higher paying job within the company. This person had ChatGPT write her a resume. While this isn’t illegal, I do think that there are ethical concerns that arise when a person does this. A reddit user known as Total_Ad_1714 points out that there are many legal issues that can come up when we are looking at generative AI. They pointed out that copywrite can become a problem when an individual is relying on AI to do most of their work. As I have previously stated, there was a reddit user that was using generative AI to write scripts for their job, and they would change it a little. They did this so that they wouldn’t have to pay a person to do this job. I think that there is an ethical concern when someone does this. This is because they are relying too much on AI to do something that they could do. They are using this to put themselves above other companies when they aren’t doing the work. Then this is an issue on a legal standpoint because of copywrite and stealing someone else’s work even if it is the work of AI."
804,S0164,3,"“Generative AI faces a lot of legal and ethical issues. The three biggest risks involve biased and false information, copyright and intellectual property issues, and data privacy violations.” 
The largest risk associated with AI is false information and bias. When the AI bot retains information, it can be pulling pieces of work from sources that are not credible. Sources that are not credible are mostly sources written by anyone who wants to post an article online. These sources are available to AI and are used when key words, numbers, and graphics are triggered in the system. Copyright is also a big issue with AI because the information AI uses can be taken from other websites and writers.This can be plagiarism and people who then use the AI’s work are plagiarizing someone’s writing. Intellectual property is another legal issue AI faces. This can include music, poems, writing, among other things AI creates from pulling information from other sources in these same genres. Lastly, data privacy violations are a big issue when it comes to ethics with AI. In many cases, AI is used to mimic the voices of very notable people. On Tiktok, Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and other famous people and public figures' voices are being used to say things they would never say. They are also portrayed to be singing songs with vulgar language in many cases. Although it can be funny, this is a case of defamation and the user that created the AI voice can be at fault for defaming the image of the celebrity.

805,S0165,3,With Generative Artificial Intelligence being so new still there are not so many legal laws or regulations put into place yet. As well as ethical issues have not been looked upon as much as it should be. As everyone knows where Generative Artificial Intelligence can go many people are looking at the ethical issue to be the wipeout of jobs real soon as Generative Artificial Intelligence is taking away more and more jobs. People are viewing that it is not ethically right for robots to take over entry level jobs and leave the people jobless as people in entry level jobs tend to not have higher education or are in the process of getting it and with Generative Artificial Intelligence taking over these jobs these employees have to have some type of higher education to rise to the next position in the workforce. Generative Artificial Intelligence has the ability to do whatever its programming capability offers it to do. From that Generative Artificial Intelligence needs laws and regulations so that Generative Artificial Intelligence cant take over mankind and do harm to society. Generative Artificial Intelligence is reducing the work load and from that it could cause people to actually have to work more as simple tasks that were time consuming not hard are completed faster it could result in the human part to have more to do in a shorter amount of time. 
806,S0166,3,"The main legal issues that come into play when incorporating generative AI into organizational settings are the concern of privacy and the distribution of false information. When the algorithm learns false information to be correct it continues to distribute this information thinking it is correct. I know from personal experience I have been given some false answers from Chat GBT. While it can be helpful for answering some questions, there are some that it is not 100% correct on and then continues to distribute false information. This could be cause for legal concern when incorporating it into an organization setting. The answer I referenced from Reddit tied in something that relates to my answer to question 2. A lawyer used a fake case in a trial due to misinformation from Chat GBT. Generative AI is using so much data from all over. The use of others’ personal information would inflict serious privacy concerns and could cause legal issues. I think this is something that many people fear when they talk about AI in total."

Massive amounts of data that may be poorly controlled, utilized without authorization, or biased are consumed by generative AI systems. Social influencers or AI systems themselves may increase the degree of accuracy to new levels. Legal and governmental difficulties could be brought up by generative AI. There could be problems with data security, privacy, liability, and compliance. There aren't any specific legal regulations in existence currently, but they might change quickly.

809,S0169,3,"Generative AI in organizational settings presents several legal and ethical challenges that require careful consideration within the proposed AI ethics framework. One significant concern is the potential for bias and discrimination in AI-generated content, as these systems can inherit biases from training data. To align with ethical principles, organizations must actively mitigate biases by using diverse datasets and continuously monitoring for discriminatory outcomes. Transparency is another key issue, with organizations urged to make their generative AI systems transparent and comprehensible, providing clear documentation of their operation to foster accountability. Additionally, organizations must respect privacy and adhere to data protection regulations, including gaining informed consent for data usage and ensuring users have control over their data when implementing generative AI.

Moreover, ensuring the security and robustness of generative AI systems is essential, as vulnerabilities can lead to cyberattacks and misuse. Accountability mechanisms should be established to hold developers and users responsible for AI-generated content and actions. Furthermore, a human-centric approach is encouraged, emphasizing that AI should complement human capabilities rather than replace them. Assessing the environmental and social impact of AI deployment, promoting collaboration among diverse stakeholders, and continuously evaluating AI systems for ethical performance are crucial elements in navigating the legal and ethical landscape. Lastly, public engagement and education efforts are essential to foster awareness and informed decision-making around responsible AI use, aligning with the proposed AI ethics framework's principles.

and make sure the work that is done by AI is good and if not, they will work on it. It discussed 
how this can be issue for people as it could add more responsibilities on them rather than help 
them. Many people believed it was plain foolishness to think AI will have that much power soon. 
Many believed that we are still 40 to 70 years away from it being this powerful, which is also a 
big “if” to them. Another interesting conversation under this thread was how they compared this 
hype for ChatGPT and other generative AI to crypto currency and NFTs. It is interesting to think, 
because if this is something that could go that route it could be bad for companies who are 
investing and incorporating generative AI to their business practices. Also with AI it is based of 
code and it will not be as great in innovation as that requires thinking out of the box and AI 
systems at the moment are far to programed to do this.  "
814,S0174,3,"Several legal and ethical issues are brought up by the incorporation of generative AI in corporate settings. Businesses need to make sure that the information used to train generative AI models complies with privacy laws. Negligent treatment of private information may have legal repercussions.
Obtaining informed consent, guaranteeing data confidentiality, and putting in place strong security measures to guard against unwanted access are all ethical considerations when using data. Numerous jurisdictions forbid discrimination on the basis of race, gender, or other protected characteristics. Legal issues may arise if generative AI algorithms unintentionally reinforce prejudices found in training data.
Ethical Considerations: To achieve fair and equal outcomes, organizations should actively endeavor to uncover and reduce biases in AI systems. Transparency in automated decision-making systems is mandated by several rules. 
"
815,S0175,3,"One user prompted ChatGPT to create its own guide to ‘Responsible and Humane Technology Development.” This was the results: 
Responsibility and accountability: Organizations and individuals using AI should be responsible and accountable for its impacts and outcomes, including any negative consequences.
Transparency: AI systems should be transparent and their decision-making processes should be understandable and explainable to ensure accountability and prevent bias.
Fairness and non-discrimination: AI should be designed and used in a manner that is fair and non-discriminatory, avoiding prejudice and harm to individuals and groups.
Privacy: AI should respect individuals' privacy rights and personal data, ensuring that personal information is collected, processed and stored in a responsible and secure manner.
Human control and oversight: AI should be designed to complement and enhance human capabilities, rather than replace them, and be subject to human control and oversight.
Sustainability and environmental responsibility: AI should be developed and used in a manner that is sustainable and protects the environment, avoiding harm and promoting positive impact.
Other sources give other examples. One such example is that some insurance companies have been accused of discrimination due to the AI model. This is true for things such as hiring as well. For example, if an applicant to a job is from a zip code that has not been hired at this company before, it will assume that is an intentional pattern and deny all applicants within that zip code. This was an oversight that had to be adjusted. 
The largest concern for private organizations is typically security and privacy. Companies hold these to a very high standard, and uploading files or asking confidential questions can prove a potential threat, especially regarding personnel information. 
Recently, Microsoft laid off their entire AI Ethics team. This caused users to worry about Microsoft’s commitment to ethics within AI. Finally, AI currently does give off false results somewhat frequently. If an organization does not constantly cross-check information given from these models, it might find itself in deep trouble. One example is about Mark Walters, who ChatGPT lied about regarding a court case, claiming he was involved and that he was stealing money from a foundation. He is currently attempting to sue OpenAI. ChatGPT does disclose that nothing it says should be relied on as factual, so if organizations were to rely on it and use incorrect analysis or information, it could lose money or even face lawsuits"

817,S0177,3,"Generative AI comes with a lot of legal and ethical challenges, some of these main concerns are biased and inaccurate information, issues regarding copyright and intellectual property, and breaches of data privacy. When it comes to generative AI, there is a risk. We know that generative AI based its information on datasets provided by data scientist and these datasets may come from biased or irrelevant sources. Generative AI is completely reliant on existing data for generating new content and raises valid questions about copyright and intellectual property rights. For instance, AI-generated music that draws from pre-existing compositions may trigger copyright disputes, necessitating clear regulations and guidelines. Lastly, the use of generative AI in crafting deepfake content, particularly in the entertainment sector, presents noteworthy concerns about data privacy. Unauthorized utilization of individuals' likeness and images without their consent or compensation sparks legal and ethical issues, alongside potential repercussions for job stability and economic equilibrium across industries.

819,S0179,3,NaN
820,S0180,3," Generative AI faces significant legal and ethical challenges, with three major risks at the
forefront. The first involves the propagation of biased and false information when the AI
learns from biased sources, leading to discrimination, inequality, and increased
polarization. A recent case highlighted this risk when a lawyer relied on information from
ChatGPT without fact-checking, resulting in severe implications and questions about its
accuracy. Second, copyright and intellectual property issues arise as generative AI uses
existing content to create new material, potentially leading to copyright disputes,
especially in the music industry. Finally, data privacy concerns emerge with the use of
deepfakes in entertainment, where unauthorized use of someone's likeness and image
raises ethical and legal concerns, impacting job stability and economic stability. While
numerous other issues exist, these three areas represent some of the most critical
challenges facing generative AI today."
821,S0181,3,"	There are several legal and ethical issues that have to do with generative AI in professional and organizational settings. I believe a few of the largest concerns have to do with job displacement, copywrite, and legal restrictions. It is predicted that 2.4 million US jobs will be replaced by generative AI. An article in one of the posts of my OKC suggests that mainly white-collar roles will be replaced and will most affect the middle-class and college-educated group. It also suggests that creative professionals should not be concerned with being replaced and instead they will use generative AI to their advantage. Within the tech industry, mature departments have been thinned out, to make way for more resources and hiring for AI departments. On a different note, the European Union have taken action to create regulations on AI, with what has been referred to as the EU AI Act. Similarly, the Federal Trade Commission has expressed concern over generative AI monopolies and that industries may resort to anti-competitive practices in the arms race. There is also a concern that training AI requires mass resources and that large companies may just acquire up-and-coming startups, lowering competition. As much concern as the FTC and citizens have expressed, the United States still have not taken such proactive measures like Europe to create regulations on AI and generative AI."
822,S0182,3,"As stated in the first question, generative AI has become controversial due to how users will use AI to recreate Art that others have spent large amounts of time manually working on. In a non-organizational standard, this just leaves a bad taste for said users who have spent all the time on their own work, only for it to be done slightly different in a matter of minutes. However, in an organizational standard, copyright infringement has been used against numerous users who follow through with this form of copying work from others, alongside generating art with AI causes uproar when used in a professional setting, as the general public believes that AI takes away jobs and work for people who are capable of providing the same content that the major companies are attempting to push out. In this situation, it just looks extremely lazy and greedy for companies to use AI over actual art for designs, shows, or other forms of media."
823,S0183,3," there are copyrights that are associated with LLM. The LLM needs material needs to learn from the material, the material that they based it on was not allowed by the original creator. This causes people's work to be stolen and not given credit. "
824,S0184,3,"Most of the legal and ethical issues arise from data collection and what is done with it. Now it is common for companies to be in hot water about what data is collected and how it is distributed. When a company uses a third-party generative AI giving it data is walking a tightrope of what is allowed for these businesses. Of course, it would be helpful for companies to use it for product analysis and forecasting, however, it is very unethical to be using those customers' data with a third-party app that others can use. There is also a legal issue with how employees will be compensated for lesser work. The AI will supplement the workload and now companies will reconsider the wages that go along with these jobs. Keep in mind that data analysts are well paid and now their jobs will be cut in half. So now companies looking to reduce their payload either will layoffs refuse any raises or try to demote. "
825,S0185,3,"	While generative AI comes with a variety of benefits that can help companies to thrive, there are several downsides to using this tool. One of the most prominent legal issues associated with generative AI is copyright and plagiarism. Because the whole premise of AI is to use pre-existing information in order to put together new information, there is a very large risk of plagiarism or copyright issues. It is very important for companies to be careful if they decide to use generative AI as an organizational tool. They must be sure to give credit where necessary to work that is not their own, and be careful when using the information from the AI tool. This is an especially important issue when it comes to organizations rather than individuals because the reputation and success of the company relies heavily on being ethical and abiding by the law. 
	Some ethical issues may also come into play when implementing generative AI. One significant issue is misleading information or bias generated from AI technology. While the creation of new information using generative AI can be extremely beneficial, it can also be harmful if this information is used to misinform others. It is very easy to alter information slightly and give it a whole new meaning. This biased and misleading information should be avoided. Additionally, there is also the ethical issue of AI potentially replacing jobs that are currently done by humans. AI may have the potential to increase unemployment and harm people and their families. 
"
826,S0186,3,NaN
827,S0187,3,"Significant legal and ethical questions are raised by the use of generative AI in organizational settings. The right to intellectual property is a significant legal issue. Questions about ownership, copyright infringement, and licensing arise when AI produces content like text, images, or music because it's not always clear whether the creator of the AI or the organization owns the output. Another issue is privacy, particularly when generative AI is used to process private information. In order to make sure that the data used for creating and training AI models complies with legal requirements, organizations must understand data protection laws, such as GDPR in Europe. Transparency and prejudice are central to ethical concerns. It can be difficult to comprehend some AI models' decision-making processes due to their ""black box"" nature, which raises concerns about responsibility and trust. AI algorithms may be biased, leading to unfair results, particularly in the hiring and lending industries. To ensure moral AI use, fairness and bias mitigation techniques must be diligently used. Additionally, the ability of AI to automate jobs may result in the displacement of the workforce, necessitating that businesses address the moral ramifications of job loss and offer retraining opportunities."
828,S0188,3,"Like anything, there are numerous issues and mixed opinions about generative artificial
intelligence in organizational or business settings. Starting off, there are some issues
when it comes to the legal side of generative artificial intelligence in these types of
settings. Since it’s an anonymous entity, something that isn’t attached to a person, by
following their suggestions or the reports that they might create can cause difficulty to
pinpoint the responsibility of any possible illegal behavior. There would be no one to
claim the consequences, therefore, sending the company away to continue any illegal or
faulty activity they are doing. Another possible legal issue that can come from generative
artificial intelligence could be privacy and cybersecurity. Those types of things could be
violated and ruin any type of confidential information that is being secured. As for the
ethical issues that might arise from using generative artificial intelligence, they could
mostly pertain to the credibility of the information. Some people might not necessarily
agree with the responses that generative artificial intelligence might create. They might
think that a piece of technology that is not experienced as them might be irritating to
some. To others they might pose a threat to their current job."
829,S0189,3,"In this community, there have been many discussions about both legal and ethical issues involving generative AI. One issue that has been brought up quite a few times in the community that encompasses both legality and ethics is that of privacy. Generative AI, like most artificial intelligence and technologies in general, requires a large amount of data to be stored in databases to be effective. With the perceived benefits of generative AI, companies are now, more than ever, incentivized to collect and store large amounts of data from customers. Ethically, this can be concerning to customers who simply want to partake in a business’s services but do not wish to be recorded. Legally, this can raise concerns about how much data is lawfully able to be collected and stored on individuals. Additionally, legal liability for organizations can be a concern if breaches of generative AI databases occur. Another issue that is commonly talked about that encompasses both legality and ethics has to do with the generations themselves. When generative AI creates something, it is based partly on already existing creations. Legal and ethical troubles can arise both when generations are too close to the things that they were based on and when figuring out whether generative AI use would be considered copyright infringement. Fair use laws have not been adapted across the world to account for the use of generative AI and there have been debates over whether or not it is ethical to use AI to create things that are similar to others’ work."
830,S0190,3,"All though generative artificial intelligence is a great tool created to make life easier and help humans out, there is still a lot of questionable things about the technology that we must figure out. For example, there are legal and ethical issues associated with generative AI that we must answer. Generative AI faces a lot of legal and ethical issues, the three biggest being copyright and intellectual property issues, biased and false information, and data privacy violations. Number issue is how generative AI kind of blurs the lines of intellectual property, as it can create content that may resemble existing copyrighted materials. It has to get the data from somewhere and at some point its going to look extremely similar to other people's works. Clear guidelines and regulations are necessary to navigate these complexities. Number 2, Generative AI can be used to create extremely convincing fake content, which can include text, images, and videos. This raises concerns about the potential for misinformation and the manipulation of public opinion, making it difficult to trust the authenticity of the content created by generative AI. And lastly, AI models could create very sensitive and private information from the data that they collected. Which could result in unwanted data being presented to the public. "
831,S0191,3,"That might be all and good, but the most people really have a problem with is the legal aspect of generative AI. This technology also raises serious ethical concerns, such as the spread of bad content, infringements on intellectual property, abuses of data privacy, and the amplification of existing biases. "
832,S0192,3,"A lot of the comments in this post talked about the ethical dilemmas arising from the biases produced by AI. Companies use generative AI to make decisions such as who to hire, how much interest to charge someone on a bank loan, and what types of ads to promote to different viewers. These decisions are based on massive amounts of data and can use factors such as zip code, income, educational level, etc. Results generated by AI can be discriminatory particularly against minorities.
For example, Amazon received negative publicity for its Recruiting AI that was found to be misogynistic. It was mostly given examples of male applicants as potential hires, and as result thought that males were suited for the job. It excluded resumes that had all-female colleges listed or extracurriculars with female words (i.e., “women’s chess club”).
One user commented that AI has been used unethically by banks and insurance companies. They use AI to screen an applicant’s expected life span. They use that information to decide whether or not to approve a policy, and how much to charge. For example, if a bank finds out that someone applying for a loan will likely die before the loan is paid out, they will not approve the loan.
Another example of AI being used unethically is search engines and websites such as YouTube where the goal is to generate the greatest number of clicks or views, regardless of the content. This can be dangerous. I’m all about free speech but there should be some oversight in certain cases. For example, someone who typed in the phrase “how to commit suicide” should first be directed to a page providing resources for depression (regardless of how many clicks it will produce).
"
833,S0193,3," While many advantages and conveniences come with artificial intelligence, there are
many ethical and legal issues associated with this technology. From a legal standpoint, it
is difficult to define ownership when it comes to generated AI. If an organization uses an
AI platform to generate any creative work, who owns it? Does it belong to the
organization or the creators of the AI? This lack of definition can pose a real dilemma.
Another legal issue with generative AI is plagiarism. Every student has seen similarity
flags on an assignment simply because they wrote about the same thing their classmates
did; there are only so many ways to write an essay on a particular subject, especially if
that subject is commonly written about. As previously explained, generative AI takes in
data and creates new works based on observed similarities. Statistically speaking AI can't
create entirely new material every time. It is unavoidable that works similar to each other
will be produced. People will use the same keywords or descriptions when working withAI, and will therefore get the same result. This can pose a huge legal issue, and the user
may not even know it.
Ethically speaking, the use of generative AI can lead to unforeseen consequences. There
is no way to be sure that AI remains unbiased or factual. It collects all forms of data, not
just correct forms. There is also a real possibility that generative AI could leak private
information."
834,S0194,3,"Although generative AI can help an organization in multiple ways, there are some
aspects to be concerned about. One issue that brought concerns to people and
organizations is privacy. As generative AI utilizes information that it already has, there
are possibilities of data leakage. Another concern is the issue with ethical data, there
may be ""unfair"" or biased data that the generative AI is pulling from, which will result in
a biased output. Organizations also need to be careful with programing their generative
AI's properly. If organizations aren't paying enough detail to this step there is possible
concern with generative AI not following the proper guidelines to using intellectual
properties.
One user stated that the biggest legal/ethical concern with generative AI is the
accuracy of the outputs. Organizations that deal with the legislature need information
provided to be verifiable and correct. Since generative AI must learn and adapt, the
information will not always be 100% correct. A lawyer that is searching law or an
accountant looking for information on the internal revenue code can not afford for the
answers to be incorrect. This can lead to huge consequences for everyone involved. In
another example, business owners looking for ways to increase profitability can be
irreversibly hurt from inaccurate information. In an organizational setting, generative AI
must be accurate or it can hurt the organization as a whole."
835,S0195,3,"There are a few ethical and legal issues associated with generative AI in organizational settings. For example, generative AI takes from already created sources to learn from and create the things it generates from AI. This can cause legal issues since for example, if it learns from a specific art style of an artist then they can claim that there are or style is being used without permission or consent. This can also happen with peoples own original words or pieces of work that can be used by AI to create something new using that. This would also allow them to create legal issues since the information that was used by the AI to create the thing that was there's originally. It can cause ethical issues too by making people loose their jobs. With generative AI, if you can create marketing ideas, art, and even written text of your choosing than many companies may find it unnecessary to hire more people for these specific things. This may cause them to lay off or even fire many employees since the benefits of having AI and not having to pay employees for these things may benefit them more. These are some of the legal and ethical issues with generative AI in organizational settings. "
836,S0196,3,"There are many growing legal and ethical issues with the use of generative AI in
organizational settings. For example images being created/altered, although the idea was
developed by you, it isn’t technically considered your intellectual property. If you were to use
images by a previous artist, but then have it altered to create something new, you could
potentially be infringing on the copyright of the previous artist. This can cause a lot of legal
issues if the original artist chooses to pursue a case against you. When developing new market
ideas, it's essential that you use AI with caution so as to not bring up legal issues. There is also a
privacy concern with using generative AI. Access to your personal information may result in a
data leak later if the company is under a cyberattack. There are also cases of AI being used to
replicate peoples’ voices in order to gain access into restricted accounts and information. This
scam is occurring more every day and it is often successful. Ethical issues can arise due to model
bias in the data used in training. Organizations will need to monitor and address AI generated
content in order to weed out any misleading or offensive material."
837,S0197,3,"Some legal and ethical issues with Generative AI is an organizational setting would be copyright issues, data privacy violations, and biased/false information. When AI platforms learn from biased information, they further distribute incorrect information that can lead to discrimination and inequality. Data privacy concerns are seen through the utilization creating imagery that is ""fake"", and creating the realism that is it real to ruin someone's reputation. This happens with a lot of celebrities, as AI creators can now make it seem so real that a celebrity might be doing something wrong, but they may have never even been apart of it."
838,S0198,3,Common ethical issues that we may see would be job displacement with jobs being replaced with machines or robots with AI capability. I would also assume that some legal issues would include issues with safety in instances where AI would be negligent to certain safety protocols that are done and checked by people on the job.

840,S0200,3,"Legal and ethical concerns include data privacy, intellectual property, and bias in AI-generated content.

841,S0201,3,"Most of the legal and ethical issues associated with generative AI in organizational settings revolve around whether or not AI is stealing jobs from humans, and as a result, will possibly take over the world one day. Another question is human privacy and how we can be safe from AI having all our information and then one day using it against us. Many think that AI is threatening the job force because it creates a quicker, efficient, and more cost effective way to do certain repetitive industrial jobs. While this is true, AI is also creating more jobs in the process. With AI, there needs to be more technology maintenance, computer science, and programming. AI is powered by no one other than humans. If humans can create it, humans can also destroy it. We need humans in positions where they are able to fix any issues they see with AI, as well as improve it. I think at the end of the day, whether or not AI destroys the human race is up to us. We must use AI in only positive ways that sprout innovation. If we become power hungry and use AI excessively, we may see a day where it takes over. This varies in opinion, but there is no doubt that AI is changing the world as we speak."
842,S0202,3,"Data privacy concerns, copyright issues, and cybersecurity issues are some of the main risks associated with generative AI that relate to legal and ethical issues. Because generative AI models are trained on vast amounts of internet data and then utilized to produce an output, copyright is a major worry. This training method enables the creation of new content using works that the original source has not expressly provided. In the case of AI-generated art in any form, including images and music, copyright is a particularly tricky problem. It is challenging to resolve these copyright issues because the precise works that generative AI models are trained on are not explicitly disclosed. Since user data is frequently stored for model training in generative AI, privacy is another key concern. Data inputted into the generative AI program could essentially be stored through user inputs and used to train other models. Cybersecurity issues can arise from the advanced powers of generative AI models, such as coding, falling into the wrong hands.Screen Shot 2023-10-08 at 7.03.56 PM.png"
843,S0203,3,"The exponential growth of Generative AI has brought about a significant amount of both
legal and ethical issues in organizational settings and in society at large. One of the largest of
these issues is regarding intellectual property. There is a gray area as far as copyright issues
regarding artificial intelligence work. If someone uses artificial intelligence to create a song or
create an art piece that clearly resembles an artist but does not brand the product as being from
that artist, it is currently unknown what laws would apply. A “sufficient amount” of something is
subjective, and any given court judge on any given day could agree or disagree with that
statement. This opens an opportunity for anyone to profit off a popular artist, celebrity, or contentcreator online. This can become a serious issue when the content produced by generative AI is
indistinguishable from real content by society. Another issue with generative is the topic of data
privacy. Many generation AI functions would require giving up sensitive information in order for
these programs to work. For example, if I wanted a program from OpenAI to assist me in
financial analysis for my company, I would have to provide one of its programs with sufficient
company information in order to conduct financial analysis. In this process, I would be giving up
information to a private company that they would otherwise not have access to. OpenAI could
use this information for themselves, sell it to a competitor, or share it with others in the process
of helping them conduct financial analysis."
844,S0204,3,"Many legal and ethical issues are associated with generative AI in organizational settings.
The biggest issue generative AI poses across all organizational settings is data privacy.
With how much personal data AI collects from its users, it leaves its users at risk in the
event of a data breach. Therefore, organizations must implement data anonymization to
protect their users’ personal information from being disclosed to unauthorized parties.
Also, the accuracy of generative AI content is a concerning legal and ethical issue. This
generated content is not verified before it is disclosed to the public. This can increase the
spread of false information and cause potential harm to others. These issues apply to the
music industry too. Generative AI is something anyone can access and has become morepopular over the years. Many people have used generative AI to create song covers using
a singer’s voice. AI has advanced a lot over the years. Now, AI can realistically replicate
a singer’s voice. People listening to the song could believe the singer sang the song
themselves. This can result in intellectual property rights and potential copyright issues.
This will become an issue if people are profiting off AI-generated music without the
singer’s consent. I have heard many AI-generated songs on TikTok and wonder how
singers feel about this. Essentially, with how easily accessible generative AI is to the
public, it leaves room for many potential legal and ethical issues."
845,S0205,3,"The integration and rapid development of AI have raised several concerns and fears. Some ethical and some legal. An ethical challenge AI inflicts is the spread of harmful content. Harmful content can be easily produced through generative AI tools. Because the misuse of AI would make disseminating harmful content easily, disinformation and misinformation in society will be increased. Another ethical challenge generative AI brings about is consent. How will another individual’s data be handled by an AI system? Job displacement is a primary ethical challenge many individuals have voiced their concern over. This realistic possibility makes the need for these discussions clear. A user shared a study outlining the roles that will be most affected by generative AI. The study also states an estimate that by the year 2030, 2.4 million workers will be replaced due to automation. Legal challenges include cybersecurity and employment. Individuals value their privacy. With the introduction of generative AI in everyday life, the chances of an individual’s data being used inappropriately greatly increase. Another legal challenge also includes employment. There may be a need for employment laws and regulations to be put in place in order to alleviate the great effect generative AI will have on employment. It is clear that while AI will provide benefits, it will also disrupt society. Therefore, laws should be put in place."
846,S0206,3,"There are many concerns with generative AI being implemented in organizational settings. For
example, the job displacement that people will have to face if machine learning improves to a
point where there is no need for a line cook at a fast food restaurant. This would take away
thousands of jobs for people that need them. On the other hand, with so many technological
advancements in the past allowing our economy to skyrocket, the same can be said about AI.
Although it takes away jobs, the slack of those jobs will be picked up somewhere else allowing
for our economy to find new innovation in other places that need improving.. There is also a
security concern of having more privacy with an online presence. With AI consuming a large
amount of your data, it can get scary with how much it knows about what you ate for dinner last
night or what shoes it thinks you will want to buy. With AI being able to make these suggestions,
it is reasonable to assume that it can lead to an invasion of privacy. Not only can AI invade
privacy, but if inaccurate information were to be inputted into AI, the spread of the
misinformation can be disastrous to the organization that let it fall through the cracks."
847,S0207,3,"Many legal and ethical issues can arise with the usage of generative AI. Speaking from my own
experience I’ve fallen victim to seeing something that I thought was really good online, thinking
it was the real deal, only to learn that the content was generated by AI software. Most notably, I
want to talk about the rapper musician Drake. Drake is a staple name in the rap music industry,with years of consistently hot releases back to back. With the rise of generative AI, a lot of
people are starting to post instrumental audio clips that are Drake inspired and would flow very
well with his song lyrics, almost plug and play if you were to just drop in a vocal track from
another one of his songs. When the legal, and more importantly ethical, issues pop up are when
people start to post Drake vocals that were generated by AI. These posts on social media
platforms can start to misdirect users and lead them to thinking they’re listening to leaked music
by Drake. Its almost like a double-edge sword because unfortunately for Drake, or fortunately,
the AI sounds really good. Aside from the legal and ethical negatives, the received well by users
who are mainly talking about how good this sounds and how sometimes AI sounds better than
Drake himself."
848,S0208,3,"One legal issue is that AI has been criticized for potentially taking jobs away from people who need the money in an economy that hasn’t been the best. With much of the criticism being pointed towards companies who would rather have a machine do work than include any human interaction, making them seem rather soulless. While I do believe there is great merit to this idea, because it has already happened in sectors of manufacturing and automation that has taken away the jobs of people over the years, it isn’t as bad as people think it is. Over many years jobs have changed and new jobs have been introduced. The idea that you should be able to work only one job the rest of your life and never have to adapt to the changing industries is wrong. With old jobs being done away with, new jobs like IT and cyber security become more important as these AI are being created. Am less issue is the concern that AI might pose a risk to humans in the future in a way if they were to ever become sentient or people coded them in a way to pose a massive risk to people. I don’t think this is based in reality, because it is still hinged on humans abusing the technology to cause such disaster. Like everything, the industry must adapt with regulations to limit human abuse and I think everything will be fine."
849,S0209,3,"However, there are plenty of legal and ethical issues regarding this type of AI. The best story to explain the legal concerns about AI is a famous selfie of a monkey the monkey took itself. The person who owned the camera published it and expected royalties based on the photo, however a US court said since the monkey took it, its not the work of the author, effectively making it free domain. Same thing can be applied to AI’s creativity.  Morally it can also take jobs away from people in the many different industries like programming, editing, and animating. The number of jobs that generative AI can take is massive and is scary. Will it totally take out professionals and leave them without jobs? We simply don’t know exactly what could happen with that. Another but less concerned part about generative AI is the fact that the content will not be made by a human. People are afraid that it could be tasteless and not original and having a human not make the plot, story and the little details is something people can be worried about with generative AI."
850,S0210,3,"Generative AI has emerged as a transformative technology that presents numerous ethical issues in the corporate business world. Generative AI can seem like magic but one of the problems it creates is the intellectual legal right. I believe when it comes to AI, government power to regulate can and will be the need of the masses. In most cases it will be based on the groups or companies that have the best legal representation to get their case or product across. This will also depend on the states where their companies are headquartered. I think in states that are technology based, they will be more receptive to all the legal ramification that goes with the implementation of AI. Science will continually evolve to give us answers and safeguard the legal rights of companies and individuals. Now, with all, profitability is always at the forefront of any invention. Investors and companies are always looking for where the next almighty dollar is going to come from. The ability of generative AI to generate human-like content can enhance productivity, but it can also lead to generating harmful or offensive content. The most concerning harm stems from the tool like deepfakes that can create false images, videos, text, or spread hate speech. "
851,S0211,3,"The community discussions shed light on the critical legal and ethical considerations surrounding generative AI. Issues such as copyright infringement, bias in AI-generated content, and privacy concerns were highlighted. Organizations must navigate these challenges carefully, ensuring they comply with regulations and ethical standards to avoid potential pitfalls."
852,S0212,3,"	Generative AI in an organizational setting, by nature of it being an automated process, could automate away jobs of creatives; thus, posing a threat to an entire labor force of the world. The legality of AI has yet to be codified in any way. It is sort of a wild west at the moment, but creatives around the world are rallying together and protesting AI. However, organizations who are keen on incorporating AI into their business model seem to have a different perspective. 
	Proponents of generative AI argue that it is a collaborator that assists creatives in brainstorming fresh ideas. According to the subreddit, “[creatives] can harness the power of Generative AI to fuel their creative processes,”. However, this notion seems to ignore the implications of AI possible innovating away a job from a person. Regardless of if a person uses AI to perform their job, AI has been used by people who are not creative to make money, market, sell commodities, etc. The implication of a job that used to require years of study and a large portfolio being replaced by an average citizen that can prompt an algorithm still stands. And there is no codified protection in place for these creative workers in this industry that can prevent a company from laying off an entire division of workers because of this due technology. It would be highly unethical to lay off an entire labor force for the sake of innovation.
	Another ethical issue is the actual process of the AI creating its “art”. Many creatives argue that due to it building a knowledge base from other people’s artwork, it does not transform that art in a meaningful way, thus violating modern US copyright laws, wherein a work must be considered transformative in some way to not be considered theft. Many believe generative AI is a thieving tool.
"
853,S0213,3,"The biggest one is obviously copyright infringement. These new images created by the computer might already exist. You must do your research to ensure that the image or video isn’t out there already. If not checked, you could get into big legal trouble. Cultures may be represented in a stereotypical or racist format. So, generated AI must be reviewed and modified to comply with cultural norms and eliminate ethical concerns. The database used to generate the AI must not be sold or used in an inappropriate way. You also want the art not to be based on sensitive or private information that could be used in a malicious way. Companies need to be held responsible for using generated AI for the wrong reasons if need be.
	Another issue is with IP. You can’t sell art of Super Mario because it’s against the law to sell products based on another company’s IP. The art must be original or in line with your firm’s IP and copyright laws. It can’t make whatever it wants to. Deepfakes can be created to misinform people about someone. This can have serious consequences and shouldn’t be used. The best way to combat generative AI from infringing on laws and regulations is to check every single piece of media to make sure it’s safe to use. Also make sure it follows culture norms and is not used for malicious purposes.
"
854,S0214,3,"•	Some of the ethical issues that are associated with generative AI in organizational settings are data privacy, employment impact, misinformation, sustainability, and plagiarism. Unfortunately, a Goldman Sachs analysis claims that 300 million full-time jobs in the US and Europe might be replaced by AI or one-fourth of all work duties (Kaggle.com). The University of Oxford research states that anywhere from 9% to 47% of employment might be eliminated to AI (Kaggle.com). This is a massive number of jobs and people who would be required to find another alternative career or skill, potentially in a short period of time. Generative AI uses a substantial amount of electricity which affects carbon dioxide levels and sustainability. The CO2 emissions in 2022 from CPT-3 produced 500 times as much as a round trip flight from New York to San Francisco according to Stanford University’s AI index report. Data privacy issues and misinformation can be an issue if the correct safeguards are not put in place to prevent it. AI can produce inaccurate information as it is based on information that is entered into the system. Additionally, there is no verifiable data governance and protection assurances in place to prevent confidential enterprise information (Kaggle.com).  This will leave enterprises subject to malicious cyber and fraud attacks. Some legal issues that can arise from generative AI are misinformation and data privacy. With the possibility of misinformation being given on behalf of the business and  cyber/fraud attacks, this could affect organizations in legal battles if these breaches to happen."
855,S0215,3,"The legal and ethical issues associated with Generative AI in an organizational setting are quite a lot. For example, recently the Grammy Awards just happened, and their company released new guidelines for being eligible for a Grammy depending on what you are producing if there is any AI involved producers, songwriters, engineers, or other artists must contribute at least 20% of the album to earn a nomination in the Grammys. If it is fully AI, they are not eligible for nomination. Something I did find fascinating reading these posts are the discussions and comments of artists being able to produce songs with artists who are no longer alive like Tupac or Michael Jackson. It is interesting to think that someone could do that, but what are the repercussions to that? Do the families have to give the okay to do that since the artists themselves are no longer here. In the other discussion they discuss how AI-generated a song and Universal Music Group claimed copyright against them. Many groups including them are worried on “which side of history” AI wants to be on and how AI is becoming a “legal minefield.” AI is very interesting, but when it comes down to what it creates how do we trust it is always going to be original when companies are already coming out and complaining of copyright. "
856,S0216,3,"Some legal and ethical issues that are associated with generative AI is the use of personal data. Generative AI could go into someone's data and start collecting a bunch of information such as credit card info., address, or anything that has to do with them. This can become very scary and can result in people not wanting to work alongside generative AI. This is where people would come in to regulate generative AI and see what happens with it. If something happens where it were to take over someone's information, then they know to stop using it. There needs to be ensured protection to make sure that nothing happens to anyone's personal information. Issues like these can result in legal and ethical issues associated with generative AI. Some ethical issues come from the data that is being used at training."
857,S0217,3,NaN
858,S0218,3,There are many legal and ethical issues associated with generative artificial intelligence as it is still developing. Artificial intelligence will not always be 100% correct as it takes data from unknown sources and applies it to your prompt. Generative AI may not only give false information but it can give biased information as it will receive data from an individual source or an opinion posted by an individual or cite that gives debatable answers that may not align correctly. Generative artificial intelligence also has the ability to misrepresent a person and give false information which can lead to false accusations and escalate a situation between someone. There may be an increase in copyright issues as AI is being used to imitate celebrities. Artificial intelligence also poses a threat to working people everywhere as it is being more and more utilized within businesses. Generative artificial intelligence is beginning to become more common in jobs like customer service and production which will replace many jobs in the near future. When artificial intelligence starts to steal more jobs this will hurt the economy and increase the unemployment rate. Artificial intelligence is still a newer concept in our society and we are still learning more and eventually restrictions and regulations will have to be made.
859,S0219,3,"The legal and ethical concerns include data privacy, intellectual property, and deepfakes in AI-generated content. Generative AI models require large datasets for training. Third parties and criminals can find ways to breach into those databases and steal users personal data. Collecting and storing this data must comply with data privacy regulations. Organizations must ensure that data is handled securely to protect sensitive information. Intellectual property is also a concern. The content generated by generative AI may infringe upon copyrights or other intellectual property rights. Organizations need to be vigilant and careful about respecting these rights, especially when generating text, images, music, or other creative works. Deep fake is another concern regarding the legal and ethical use of generative AI. It can be used to create deep fake videos, audio, and text, which can be used for malicious purposes, including spreading false information or impersonating individuals. Organizations need to be aware of these risks and take steps to counter them. To address these legal and ethical challenges, organizations should establish clear policies and guidelines for the use of generative AI, conduct thorough risk assessments, and engage in ongoing monitoring and auditing of AI systems. Collaboration with legal experts, ethicists, and regulatory bodies can also help organizations navigate the complex landscape of generative AI in a responsible and compliant manner."
860,S0220,3,"a.	The legal and ethical issues associated with generative AI in organizational settings are copyright and intellectual property. Since the technology is using procedures and information from the past, it has the potential to generate copyrighted content. Another issue is the privacy of user data. There is always the possibility of technology having too much power. Generative AI has a high chance of doing this because it has so much past information. Another issue with generative AI is how much power it has and the concern of lessening human jobs. Since it is so effective and is much cheaper than labor, more companies will want to replace human labor with technology. A large issue with almost all technology is the production of inaccurate information. Since the technology is not always fact-checked, there is a higher chance of incorrect information being produced. For example, Chat GPT does not always have accurate information if their sources are not accurate. Another concern is that users are not sure where the information they are entering is stored. Their personal information could be being sold or stored which could cause harm to the users. There are also issues for those who control the information. The way their information is worded in the contracts or terms of the agreement must remain ethical. It is unfair for people to be tricked due to specific wording and be taken advantage of."
861,S0221,3,"There are several legal and ethical issues that arise in association with generative AI.
One is ownership rights. If a product/service became majorly popularized from the creation of
the AI then there would be difficulty in understanding who owns the right to that product/service.
In which a matter of ownership is in question: the organization that created the AI network, The
AI itself, or the person who designed the product/service. This can lead to an ongoing legal
dispute for ownership rights and legal tension. Further risk of plagiarism can also occur when a
user generates content from AI which can lead to copyright infringements. If an AI database is
preset on biased information it can affect the way it gives out information to users. Having a
balanced algorithm allows for unprecedented biases to occur when a task is given by a user.
There is also a concern about AI replacing human jobs since it takes on a more tedious workload,
there would possibly be fewer jobs available for individuals. Implementation of how to properly
use and guide AI should be enforced to avoid unwarranted mistakes. Planning efficiently andbeing attentive to legal regulations ensures the advancement of AI in the business industry to
flourish."
862,S0222,3,"	Although generative AI undoubtedly has practical functionalities that serves adequately for organizational efficiency, generative AI undeniably faces ethical issues regarding intellectual property as generative AI can produce quarrel occurrences amongst organizations questioning the retaining rights of the generative AI. Additionally, with generative AI having prowess functionalities, ethical issue occurrences are inevitable because generative AI enhancing content needs could unluckily cause organizations to obtain content needs that have bits of resemblances occurring already present online. On the other hand, generative AI has inevitable ethical issues regarding privacy since individuals exposed to generative AI can be perturb in knowing how generative AI utilizes sensitive information for training purposes to enhance organizational needs. Also, generative AI can be involved with inevitable ethical issues when biases arise since generative AI utilizing biased information for training purposes can lead generative AI to provide organizations, journalists, etc., with prejudice information that would perturb groups of individuals. For instance, a journalist that has unethical involvement by previously involving biases could utilize ChatGPT to provide prompts of information pertaining to impoverishing disfavored groups of individuals, and ChatGPT would not prevent the perturbing information due to ChatGPT being accustomed to biased information. Finally, generative AI within unethical hands can inevitably raise ethical issues with misinformation since there could be instances of organizations, journalists, etc. faking information to skew average individuals away from making concise decisions. "
863,S0223,3,"Generative AI can be particularly useful in organizational settings, as explained in the responses to questions 1 and 2, but it has also brought up legal and ethical issues. A few of these issues include (1) privacy, (2) bias, and (3) accuracy. (1) Generative AI has failed in not entering or using confidential data. AI, and its organization, has no legal right in using classified data or data that is not open for public use. (2) When AI is given a few sources to use or programmed to use a few sources, the outputs of AI are biased. AI would only provide its user a response that it created by using only a little data that will lean to one side of a topic than providing a neutral response. This type of fail would cause an organization to make bad decisions. (3) In addition to that, accuracy is also something that would cause an organization to make wrong decisions. Relying a lot on AI, especially when it is still a work in progress, can lead to having inaccurate responses. AI might not have the data it needs to make a correct response. A human is not always 100% correct. AI also has that problem and would be more exposed to that problem if humans do not accept the fact that AI might fail in being accurate. "
864,S0224,3,"Generative AI in organizational settings presents several legal and ethical issues that organizations and policymakers need to address. These issues revolve around data privacy, accountability, bias, intellectual property, and more. Organizations must obtain clear and informed consent from individuals when using their data for generative AI applications. This is especially important in situations where personal data is used to personalize content or make recommendations. Storing and processing large datasets for generative AI can lead to data breaches. Organizations must implement robust security measures to protect sensitive information. Generative AI models can inherit biases present in their training data, resulting in biased content or recommendations. Organizations should strive to minimize bias and ensure fairness in AI-generated content, particularly when it relates to sensitive topics like race, gender, or religion. When used in recruitment or HR, generative AI can inadvertently perpetuate biases present in historical hiring data, leading to discriminatory practices. Determining the ownership of content generated by AI can be complex. Organizations must clarify whether the AI, the developer, or the end-user holds the rights to the generated content. AI-generated content may inadvertently replicate existing copyrighted material, leading to plagiarism issues. Organizations must ensure that generated content is original and doesn't infringe on copyright. Identifying responsibility in case of AI-generated errors, misinformation, or harm can be challenging. Organizations need to establish clear lines of accountability. It can be challenging to understand how AI algorithms arrive at specific recommendations or content. Organizations must strive for transparency in AI decision-making processes. The use of generative AI to create deepfake videos or misinformation poses significant ethical and legal risks, such as defamation, privacy invasion, or fraud. Users should be informed when interacting with AI-generated content or chatbots to ensure they are aware that they are not interacting with a human. "
865,S0225,3,"The issues when it comes to generative AI is privacy and data. As mentioned in the
beginning, it uses human intervention to kind of find patterns in what was asked in the
beginning. With generative AI, it kind of keeps track of what was said in the beginning
and just continues on from there. On top of that, something that could come up is a
data/privacy leak. Just like what happened in Vegas recently with the MGM resorts, there
was a privacy/data breach. It is kind of the same thing, generative AI looks for patterns
and it kind of makes it so that it keeps track. Another thing is because it is generated fromsimilar content or phrases, there could potentially be errors in the long run or just simply"
866,S0226,3,"Since Generative AI has access to a variety of information this leads to certain problems
as to where and who did they get that information from. This really stems from people's
creativity. While reading the first reply to this reddit post his concern was copyright. If AI
is able to mimic styles or songs from artists or just content creators in general. The
question now becomes who gets the credit for it. If studios are able to invest in AI to
create ideas that stem from all these creators will people be allowed to sue these
studios or companies that invest in AI. With this there is definitely a fine line that is tricky
to establish what is stolen or inspired by which will be interesting to see what lawmakers
do. Because while these AI gather all this information not all of them give you a deep
look at where they got their information from. Another problem that comes from AI vast
access to data is data privacy. While AI utilizes the information it already has there is
that possibility of data leakage from it. One redditor who responded to the post brought
up a great point. Even though AI is fast at gathering information that doesn't mean it's100 percent accurate all the time. So if lawyers, accountants or businesses are given
wrong information this can really trickle down and get them into trouble later on."
867,S0227,3,"The main ethical issue that seems to be presented with the vast incorporation of AI into many aspects of our everyday lives is that it presents a negative impact on humans by dumbing them down and making them too reliant on it. The majority of humans widely recognize AI as being much more intelligent than themselves, and rightfully so. We are constantly getting told about how high-tech and capable these machines are, and despite this being true for the most part, this gives the impression that they are incapable of committing mistakes, which is false. "
868,S0228,3,"Generative AI in organizational settings raises various legal and ethical issues that 
organizations need to consider when developing and deploying such technologies.  
To address these legal and ethical concerns, organizations should adopt responsible AI 
practices. This includes conducting thorough ethical assessments, implementing fairness and 
bias mitigation techniques, providing ongoing human oversight, and following relevant laws 
and regulations. Collaboration with experts in ethics, law, and AI can help organizations 
navigate these complex issues and develop AI strategies that align with ethical and legal 
standards.  
Some key concerns include: 
Intellectual Property and Copyright: Generative AI can inadvertently generate content that 
closely resembles copyrighted material, leading to concerns with plagiarism and copyright infringement. Organizations need to ensure that AI-generated content doesn’t violate 
copyright laws. 
Privacy and Data Protection: If AI uses personal data to generate content, organizations 
must comply with data protection regulations. The use of generative AI in creating audio 
impersonations can infringe on individuals’ privacy rights and lead to misuse.  
Accountability and Responsibility: Determining liability for AI-generated content can be 
challenging. Organizations should clarify responsibility and accountability in cases where AI-
generated content causes harm or legal issues. Having human oversight in AI-generated 
content is essential to ensure ethical and legal standards are in place.  
Consumer Trust: Organizations should be transparent about the use of generative AI in their 
products and services. Consumers have the right to know when they’re interacting with AI-
generated content. Getting informed consent from users when AI-generated content is 
involved is important, especially in cases like chatbots or virtual assistants. 
Security: AI systems can be vulnerable to attacks. Organizations must implement excellent 
security measures to protect generative AI models and data use.  "
869,S0229,3,"One of the Reddit posts talked about a man named Mark Walters, a radio host from Georgia, who is suing Open AI. Mr. Walter is accusing the AI chatbot called ChatGPT of telling a reporter that he was stealing money from The Second Amendment Foundation when the AI system made it up itself. The lawsuit argues that companies like OpenAI should be responsible for the mistakes their AI chatbots make, even if they can potentially harm people. Another Reddit post speaks about how AI art frustrates the art community as it merges images available online and creates them as its own. It is something that many think is copying work or defaming someone. AI is something new, and people want it to be regulated. One thing popped into my mind, and its AI is functioning how it’s supposed to be. The ethical and legal issues would be users using AI with malicious intent or naive navigating it. Some legal or ethical issues associated with AI are how it can get information, images, or music and make it for someone. The operators who created some generative AI stated clearly in the beginning how it is still an undergoing process that still needs improvements. AI combines information like text, music, and art to create a model. They make it open to the public to see and use to have an idea of how it can help so many people. They will also fix its flaws on the way. AI is part of our lifestyle, and we need to adapt it to our life. AI is good, but people should not depend on it. Inputting AI in an organization is good to make it do tasks to make as few mistakes as possible. However, it is not reliable to do everything in the workforce. Corporations need to regulate the system to save themselves a lawsuit."
870,S0230,3,"3.	Legal and ethical issues associated with Generative AI will be a huge concern not only for companies that allow the tool but also for institutions of learning. My company does not allow the use of Generative AI tools due to privacy laws not being fully understood. Until we realized what information is being kept for generative AI consumption and employees' understanding of what information can be entered into the software, we believed it was wise for a company to prohibit using the software in a corporate setting.  There are articles along with statistics that show productivity in the workplace has risen with the advent of the software being made available.  However, companies should be cautious of the tool being used under the guise of their employees. Intellectual property is the key, and making sure that property stays with your company and is not given to a tool made available to the masses is what you want to avoid. Putting the responsibility on the users will be an issue without a policy or at least some training involved."
871,S0231,3,"	The legal and ethical issues associated with generative AI in an organizational setting begin with misinterpretation of information and the possibility of copyright. Generative AI takes data and information it finds similar to form a document or video of what the main topic it is tasked to do. With artificial intelligence's ability to gather lots of information, it could have information that is not 100% accurate based on the source of the information. There also can be legal issues with generative AI from copyright. Since artificial intelligence is able to create its own information, it could end up taking research from someone that would lead to a business getting in trouble for stealing information that is not owned by them. In an organization if generative AI is not fully controlled, there could be issues with company data and classified information getting seen by people that shouldn’t be seen. This can cause legality issues with privacy information getting leaked of employees and business decisions. Organizations should be coming up with their own information relative to data research they are using without trying to take shortcuts in a faster use of generative AI. By doing this, they will be protected from getting sued and have a higher security on their information protected from data breaches. "
872,S0232,3,"There are many legal and ethical issues with using Generative AI, such as copyright, Intellectual Property (IP), and creativity.  Ethically relying on generative AI to produce content, a source such as chatGBT could be getting the information from the wrong source and provide false information. For an organization this can pose an issue, legally, since with AI there is no copyright because the human is using a tool to create something, so it doesn’t provide much protection unless a human created the content for the organization. 
Depending on the generative AI software or app that you use, you can be given full rights to the text, video, images etc. If an AI was trained using copyrighted images without proper licenses, there might be potential legal issues with the generated images, even if they appear original.

873,S0233,3,"The widespread use of artificial intelligence has lead to a lot of concerns both
legally and ethically. Of course, it makes a huge difference how you use these tools.
Such a powerful tool can be used for both good and bad. One such issue within
organizations is the use of copyrighted material. By asking an AI to develop something
(such as a report, art, etc.) it could replicate an existing copyrighted work. This could be
done on purpose or by accident.
AI usage could also be a form of liability for organizations. By using the content or
programs of AI, the organization itself is also responsible for the outcomes that are
created through the AI. In a hiring process, for example, artificial intelligence could be
prejudice towards certain groups. This is a big problem. If this is discovered, you may
have a giant lawsuit on your hands. It’s just important to be careful with how you use
tools like this."
874,S0234,3,"Generative AI certainly poses some ethical and legal questions when it comes to its use in business settings. Organizations can definitely take advantage of generative AI in unethical ways, and it will likely turn out to be some organizations using it unethically or illegally and others following the rules. This might cause certain organizations to gain an advantage over those who choose to follow the rules. One of the concerns would be of the privacy with the technology and how it could put other’s privacy at risk. On a similar note, those who are high in power have the potential to misuse the technology and either jeopardize the privacy of individuals or other organizations using the technology. Another concern would be with using the power of generative AI to fake your level of skill or professionalism. Generative AI is at a point now to where you can use it for a large number of things, which can help aid you in performing tasks. This can be seen as a good thing for some, but for others this might put a good amount of the professional workforce at risk. For instance, it can be used to cheat in school and allow people to get into fields they shouldn’t be in the first place. "
875,S0235,3,"One of the biggest concerns I’ve found and learned about while researching
legal and ethical issues pertains to personal data and the potential of data privacy violations.
Many individuals are concerned that personal data may be used by generative AI tools without
the consent of many individuals. Furthermore, many generative AI tools also take inspiration
from the work of artists without their knowledge and consent. For example, I’ve learned that
many artists and music writers have gotten into legal disputes because generative AI has taken
their personal work without their permission. Essentially, this is the work of plagiarism
according to the authors, artists, and music writers."
876,S0236,3,"Taking a closer look, generative AI is in a gray zone when it comes to legality. The issue of copyright infringement hasn’t been completely settled, and there are ongoing lawsuits concerning intellectual property. There are also issues concerning the rights of individuals who did not agree to being used as data for AI, so organizations must ensure that they use AI in a way that does not infringe on the rights of humans. Ethically, AI is still susceptible to inaccuracies and discrimination, so the data being generated can reinforce harmful stereotypes and bias that can harm the ethical responsibility of organizations. Businesses using generative AI must be aware of these issues and establish firm practices to verify that the content does not harm or use illegal data, or else they are putting themselves at risk financially and to their reputation. From the community, most users believe that in order to avoid ethical and legal issues, organizations should use AI as a guideline to brainstorm ideas and provide boosts when using generative tools, and to provide data that does not produce potentially harmful results. I also feel that companies who employ humans to learn and use AI within their organization should employ guidelines so that humans can ethically interact with generative AI and produce content that privides a positive impact.

878,S0238,3,"	There are many legal and ethical issues surrounding generative AI. Ranging from copyright, intellectual property, and creativity, generative AI can pose as a false hope for people relying solely on generative AI to create work.
	The first item to consider is the AI one is using when they are creating. Some AIs use outsourced information and others use in-house. Some generative AIs also have different rules on the ownership of content created. Sometimes the creator owns the content, and other times the generator owns all content created.
	Another item to also consider is the fact that some generated content might include direct copies from other content. This means that although most of your content is unique, there might be a design or text directly ripped off of another piece of content in the Generative AIs library. In order to avoid trouble due to this, it is important to check with other similar works, and compensate creators if you are using some of their work, as well as adding some input yourself.
	The most important thing to remember about generative AI is that it should not be relied on as the main source of creativity. Generative AI is a great tool to help inspire creators. It is a good assistant. However when it is relied on as the main source of content, many troubles can begin. It is also important to disclose the use of Generative AI when it is used.
"
879,S0239,3,"	One of the biggest legal challenges being faced right now is what is considered copyright infringement when it comes to generative AI. Most times people relate this to the aspect of art, but it could be a problem in organizational settings too. The entertainment industry will have to figure out if deepfakes and using someone’s likeness is against the rules. Also, a problem is if generative AI uses training data that is not its own and creates a movie plot based on it, how do we determine if it is too closely related to be considered copyright. Also, in this day an age data privacy is a big concern. If companies use generative AI and it gets ahold of important information, how will data privacy be changed so that there are no leaks or unwanted sharing of information. Ethical issues with generative AI could relate to as generative AI becomes more efficient, how do we protect workers and keep jobs while still using generative AI to benefit the company and its workers. Any organizations within the art industries will have to decide what is ethical when it comes to using people’s pictures, art, art styles, and other artist creations to give to generative art to create something new."
880,S0240,3," With every disruptive technological innovation, fear follows and reasonably so.
Generative AI has the ability to manufacture text speech, pictures, and audio that mimichuman performance. Such an ability is both impressive but ethically ambiguous. Fake
images and videos can spread false news. Once the media takes hold of the deep fakes,
false information would spread like wildfire. Additionally, law does not protect
individuals explicitly from deep fakes being created of them. Celebrities, for example,
have fought back generative AI exploiting their sound in audio clips released on social
media. Therefore, copyright infringement begs the questions of whether generative AI
counts as copyright. In the organization setting, generative AI could be ethically
questioned as plagiarism. If AI is generating ideas, then the need for human innovation is
miniscule. Organizations’ reputations are also at risk. As stated previously, fake
information could be generated to mimic the organization in a negative light and thus
taint their reputation."
881,S0241,3,"The main concern with generative AI are the privacy issues it imposes. Generative AI is trained to search and amass the sea of information that is the internet, including information that may be sensitive or that the user obtaining the AI generated may not have legal access to. As well, it imposes privacy issues in terms of keeping data private. In a society where most information is available to the internet, the idea that this information may somehow surface in an AI generation inquiry exists. As well, ethically, AI generations often mimic real life, as they do so with patterns in generating new content. Many artists have become frustrated as art that includes tremendous time and effort is upshone by a model that can generate a piece of similar style but of higher quality and without the work, the concern of devaluation arises as well. The final issue includes that pertaining to bias patterns and the AI models ability to pick up on these cues. Much of the data obtained will likely impose some bias that AI models may pick up and generate itself, defeating the purpose of the models in the first place."
882,S0242,3,"There are a lot of ethical issues that are associated with generative AI, such as impersonating a human employee. Companies can use generative AI to impersonate a real human employee, such as impersonating a real human customer service agent. The intention here is to deceive customers into thinking that they are actually having a conversation with a real person, which isn’t very ethical. The only way that this would deem to be ethical is if the company is transparent about this, and lets customers know that they are having conversation with AI. 
	Based on my research, there isn’t a lot of coverage about “legal” issues in regards to generative AI in organizations in this subreddit. However, there is news about how the EU has adapted an AI act. This is the world’s first legal framework for artificial intelligence, dealing with limitations with AI. Though this isn’t an act directed towards organizations, the generative AI tools that organizations use in the EU must pass different standards. For example, if ChatGPT is used to generate text, it must be disclosed that the content was generated by AI. 
	Though not directly related to an organization, a big “legal” issue that is talked about with generative AI is pornography. Generative AI technology can be used to create “deepfakes” of people, and with the technology improving, they’re becoming more realistic and advanced. When these deepfakes of people are shared, they can be argued to be “nonconsensual porn” which is illegal.

883,S0243,3,"Legal and ethical problems surrounding AI are prominent and may have delayed the complete transition of AI into the workplace. For my biggest idea of ethical dilemmas is automating the workplace, as it is taking away jobs from workers and forcing a harder life for people. While it would be more accurate, it may be worse for the company if it has customers that prefer their products to be handcrafted by a real and trusted professional. Many people can be tentative and even hate the idea of AI, as media has forced a tough image of AI through the movies Terminator, I Robot, and more. On top of this, the impact on the nature of the world may be in a negative light as well, depending on what the AI could be using to operate their system. Legality is also a concern, as a generative AI that is perfecting its data and predictability could end up being a form of insider trading, depending on the ability to predict the stock market. This is obviously illegal, as insider trading is not allowed in a fair trade market. This can extend beyond trading, however, as programs like ChatGPT can hover the line of legality with the amount of analytical advantage it can give, especially regarding school."
884,S0244,3,"Generative AI can raise ethical issues, mostly related to bias, discrimination, or bad practices. AI models
learn from data and may reinforce existing biases or wrongful information in the data. Some ethical issues may
concern users being decived, copyright abuses, lack of accountability, safety issues, and transparency. Legal
issues can include violating copyrights from the AI taking images from the internet. On tik tok theres this AI
generator that can mimic an artists vocals and can sing someone elses song this can be a violation or lawsuit
for artists since people are profiting of this AI using the artist voice to create a song. Data and security is a big
issue because these ai generators can be easily hacked and personal information could be made known to
the public. Usually I see a lot of AI copyright infringement lots of data being stolen from other people
to crate otr give service to others. I dont think that AI is reliable to consumers because misinformation
and glitches will be present which will make information not true and believable. AI is not neutral:
AI-based decisions are susceptible to inaccuracies, discriminatory outcomes, embedded or inserted bias."
885,S0245,3,"From their answer, they were not too sure about legal and ethical issues with generative AI in organizations. However, they still came up with an interesting point. One legal or ethical issue is the potential use of generative AI to stifle or slow the progress of competitors. This could be done by impersonating people or users using generative AI to make it seem like they are saying something, when in reality they are not. Even today, there are examples of generative AI that mimics the voice of celebrities or presidents, and users can put in text and have the AI speak as if they were the person being impersonated. It can sound pretty real, especially if one is paying a lot of attention to how the voice sounds. In the future, voices will be nearly impossible to verify if they are from a real person or an AI, and this is something that can quickly become an ethical issue. If a company used an AI with this power to make a competitor sound bad or hateful, it may be difficult for the competitor to prove that it is AI. The above answer also talks about using generative AI to amplify their own organization. They may utilize generative AI to make their organization sound better than it actually is. Or they may try to fool investors with data that is summarized by a generative AI that is meant to be misleading. "
886,S0246,3,"One of the legal issues I came across associated with generative AI is the arguments regarding copyright
laws. It appears that organizations will not be able to mark generative images as their property which
will allow others to use these images. This can cause problems within the organizations marketing and
branding if the images originally associated with the company are used by outsiders in ways that
negatively paint the company Although this may change as the generative AI continues to grow there
would also be legal issues of owner ship would the company who created the generative AI have
ownership of the product or will the company who uses it. Without very detailed contracts I can see this
issue being battled in court for many years. In terms of ethical issues, I saw a lot of fear mongering such
as the post included and comments discussing it about generative AI taking jobs away from humans.
While I don’t think it would be replacing all humans, I can understand a potential decrease in the job
market. If one financial advisor can perform tasks at a quicker speed, would they remove the need for
two other advisors? Most companies want to keep expenses low, but would it be ethical to replace
human stuff with generative AI and how will the public react if this occurred? I think companies will be
faced with these ethical issues as generative AI continues to advance."
887,S0247,3,"•	The biggest issue ethically with generative AI is the system is based on and created by humans who have biases. Even if bias is not built within, AI itself can become biased by favoriting certain pathways or responses. Bias is part of everyday life. However, AI has little oversight, and without oversight, it can cause companies to face lawsuits if they rely too much on the data of AI. One of the major issues that is spoken about in Congress as well is how much we are willing to let AI take over and, in the end, what jobs will be left for us to work. I am unaware of the current laws in the U.S. for AI, but I have read that the EU has implemented a framework for what AI can do and oversight requirements. When it comes to the legality of generative AI, it can create data or intellectual property issues that may infringe on copyright and ownership. The amount of data that AI pulls might unknowingly also pull private information that does not comply with privacy laws. With all this considered, the amount of oversight of AI might cause more issues than it provides. What is also stopping professional from using generative AI such as Chat GPT to do their work for them? Ethically, this is wrong in some cases when it comes to giving clients professional opinions from, say, a CPA, compared to when it comes to brainstorming ideas in marketing, which would be encouraged. Guidelines need to be created."

889,S0249,3,"With any new invention or innovation, legal and ethical concerns will always arise and with the brand new concept of generative AI, this is no different. One of the biggest ethical concerns that comes to mind is the issue of data privacy. We have seen countless times with large corporations have problems with data leaks and revealing very sensitive information about the person that uses that specific service. Because of the way that generative AI works and how it collects data to create something, a data leak would be a big problem. Could this company that created this AI be safe for the consumer and have their data stored securely without it getting leaked is a question to ask for both respective parties: the consumer and also the organization. One other issue that may arise is how to filter the misleading or inappropriate information that the AI may spew out as part of an ad campaign.  A similar ethical issue would be how the AI would be used, whether that is for good or for causing harm. We can confidently say that, a majority of the time, it would be used for good for organizations to better their product or service. "
890,S0250,3,"Some legal and ethical issues associated with generative AI in organizational settings are the lack of job opportunities for people and cheating. Because of the rising popularity of AI, some people are struggling to find a job because simple tasks are being replaced by AI. In addition, schools and universities are facing issues with students using Chatgpt and other AI assistants for their assignments. I believe with the development of AI it’s inevitable to stop students from using chatgpt. Using chatbpt can prevent students from getting a deeper understanding of the subject. To promote better education, Universities and schools should change. They should come up with AI that detects AI-generated works or create educational Chatgpt that helps students learn instead of simply copying and pasting. Furthermore, instead of just punishing students for using chatgpt, they should encourage the use of new technologies and AI by teaching them the appropriate way to control and prompt Chatgpt. In the near future, everything will be implemented with AI. This means children or students need to be aware of the proper ways to handle AI. I know it will be hard for teachers and educators to stay up to date with changing technologies but change in the education system needs to happen fast to help students thrive in modern society. "
891,S0251,3,"Legal and ethical issues associated with generative AI in organizational settings is that 
Intellectual Property (IP) and Copyright pose significant legal and ethical dilemmas in 
AI. These include unclear content ownership, potential copyright violations, fair use 
challenges, ethical attribution, and the need for evolving legal frameworks. To address 
these concerns, organizations must establish clear policies, ensure copyright 
compliance, attribute AI-generated content transparently, educate stakeholders, and 
advocate for appropriate legal standards. These steps are essential for responsible AI 
use while respecting content creators' rights. 
Also, copyright infringement with AI is a complex issue. AI-generated content blurs 
ownership, risking disputes over intellectual property. Unlawful replication of 
copyrighted material and ethical concerns arise, impacting academia and journalism. 
Misleading the public erodes trust, and legal liability looms for organizations. Clear 
policies, compliance, and transparency are crucial solutions. Ethical concerns surrounding generative AI in organizations encompass biases, 
misinformation, privacy, transparency, workforce displacement, trust, authenticity, 
ethical use, and overreliance on AI. Addressing these concerns is vital for responsible 
AI adoption. Measures include bias mitigation, data privacy compliance, transparency, 
employee training, maintaining consumer trust through transparency, and ensuring AI

for establishing ethical guidelines and norms, fostering responsible AI usage, and 
preventing misuse in organizational settings. "
892,S0252,3,"The biggest potential problem regarding ethical and legal issues using AI generative services are for one: copyright. Since generative AI uses existing datasets to create new information, there is a high potential that the new information the AI generative service provides will be copyrighted. This includes text services, images, and even the processing of information and distribution networks that AI can provide. Another issue ethically is job displacement. It is possible and frankly has already started that AI can make certain jobs, such as tech support, obsolete. Simply because AI, using the examples from above can streamline and finish these tasks ten times or more faster than a human can. Lastly, ethical issues can be raised in regards to a company using AI to fulfill its deliverables. Since chat GPT uses existing data to create new data, this can oftentimes be easily fixed by providing the AI generative service a company’s terms of service and policies so that it always follows those guidelines when creating a deliverable. 

"
893,S0253,3,"Since generative AI does use content from what is already available on the internet, there could be potential legal rights on intellectual property. An artist’s work can be used without their knowledge and the company, that did not obtain appropriate approval/permission to use the work might have financial gain and not share it with the original creator. AI pull information without pulling the sources of where the information, content, or images were pulled from. This could potentially cause original works to be claims as someone else’s work. This also ties in the ethical issues; the company that created, or that owns, the AI could potentially deny claims of using others’ work to get financial gain or compensation. They could also be using someone else’s work without even knowing they are doing so. There are many uncertainties with how data is being pulled and whether it is being done so in an ethical way, but since generative AI is still so new, there will probably be many issues associated with it, in the future. The same can be argued when it comes to users of the AI technology, which we have already seen; individuals are able to pull data and information from AI systems and claim that it is their creation or their work, when it actually came from the AI. 

"
894,S0254,3,"The ethical problems of generative AI are vast. Though generative AI has great creative capacity, it tends to be very generic and sometimes biased. One of my OKC group members talked about this in a lecture video he posted, saying that generative AI is biased because humans are biased. We create the AI to think as closely as humans, and unfortunately, people are biased naturally in some way. In the lecture from Patrick Henz, he uses an example from an art-generating AI. Henz uses the prompt “Mexicans” and “Americans;” the generator depicts “Mexicans” as mariachi and the “Americans” as a happy family (MedicReS, 2023). If generative AI is so biased, would this impact legal issues with discrimination? According to Patrick Henz, there aren’t complete laws implemented for AI because it acts on its programming. Some laws affect the creations generative AI makes. According to Code 306 of the U.S. Copyright Office, the Office can refuse a claim for creation if they find it was not created by a human (Copyrightable Authorship: What Can Be Registered) It is possible that in the future we will see more laws implemented that affect AI, but as we have started building up on generative AI in a short period, it will take a long time to determine the responsibilities."
895,S0255,3,"	The main legal issues that are related to AI of any kind are the privacy, and the copyright issues. If generative AI is something that learns through being fed information, how can someone protect their information online against such a tool? We are people that effectively have second lives within the internet, all of our bank information, pictures of our loved ones, and even our darkest secrets, all live within the internet. If generative AI is to be fed information, people are surely scared of what it means for their private information. The question becomes how far do we allow a tool that can positively effect our lives run for, until millions of people have their data leaked by it. On the other hand, copyright with generative AI is also a big talking point at the moment. How are creatives supposed to deal with AI taking away their years of hardwork and talent, in the matter of seconds. If generative AI can be used to create different forms of art, artists must fight against it if they want to keep their creations their own. I believe that this will be one of the first big roadblock for generative AI. Since art is something so human, we are sure to see regulation fighting against AI making art that replicates that of a living artist.

896,S0256,3,"o	There are a large variety of ethical and legal issues associated with generative AI in organizational settings. For example, data privacy is a huge legal issue. Organizations that deal with individuals’ sensitive information, such as lawyers, accountants, & government agencies, must be aware of the security concerns within generative AI. Being a newer and more open space technology, generative AI does not have the proven security that other programs these organizations use. The validity of information provided by generative AI also applies to all of these organizations. Although the innovation of generative AI is clear, the program still needs to learn and sample to ensure accuracy. Organizations that are dealing with legal can be misled; therefore, leading to huge consequences for the organization. The unsure validity of information provided is a huge issue in these cases. Job security is another ethical concern of generative AI. The technology can complete a wide variety of lower-level jobs which would put people out of work. It is a very fine line between helping individuals complete their job more efficiently & replacing them all together. This could hurt many individuals livelihoods across the world. Although the technology is impressive, there are many issues that still need to be sorted out before it can be used across industries."
897,S0257,3,"While generative AI holds significant promise and has demonstrated remarkable capabilities, there are several concerns and potential issues that researchers and society must address as this technology continues to evolve. The ability to generate realistic content, such as deepfake videos and images, raises concerns about the potential misuse of generative AI for spreading misinformation or creating fraudulent content. If the training data used for generative AI models contains biases, these biases can be enforced in the generated content. This raises concerns about fairness and equity, especially if the generated content reflects and follows societal biases. Generative AI can be used unethically for malicious purposes, such as creating fake identities, forging documents, or generating content that can be harmful to individuals and communities. The generation of realistic fake content can pose security risks, such as creating forged images or videos for identity theft or using generated content to deceive security systems. This technology could potentially be used to create realistic depictions of individuals who did not consent to being featured in generated content, leading to privacy issues. As generative AI becomes more sophisticated, it could become increasingly challenging to distinguish between real and generated content, which may have implications for authentication and verification processes. This misinformation could be developed to access personal information and assets of any individual if the proper procedures are not taken place to prevent them. "
898,S0258,3,"●	As cool and innovative generative AI is, there are legal and privacy issues that arise from it. When companies use generative AI, there is a risk that the generative AI may be invading privacy policies and using resources from places it should not be using. Data security, privacy, liability, and compliance issues may arise from the use of generative AI and companies can be sued for it. The generative AI models might generate content that is not in line with the expectations or standards of the organization. Inaccurate or inappropriate content may be generated which could harm the company’s reputation and lead to legal consequences. Along with that, generative AI can raise ethical issues, particularly related to bias, discrimination, or manipulative practices. AI models learn from data and may reinforce existing biases or inequalities in the data. Generative AI models are not error-free and may produce unpredictable or unreliable results. There is a risk that generated content may need to be more accurate, consistent, or simply unusable. Some people are starting companies where they use generative AI to produce content to sell to companies. For example, people use ChatGPT to write SEO for a company and sell it. This can raise ethical issues as it is someone selling a work generated by AI with a click of a button rather than the old school way of learning how to write SEO and coming up with the content themselves.

 legal consequences and potentially damage an organization's reputation.Generative AI 
 models can unintentionally amplify biases that exist in the data they were trained on. 
 This can result in discriminatory or unfair outputs. Organizations have a responsibility to 
 actively tackle bias and fairness concerns to avoid ethical and legal complications. 
 Some AI models operate as ""black boxes,"" making it challenging to understand how 
 they make decisions or generate content. This lack of transparency can create 
 difficulties in holding individuals or entities accountable for AI-generated outcomes. 
 Generative AI has the capability to generate fake content, including deceptive videos or 
 fraudulent articles. This raises significant concerns about the spread of misinformation

 organizations take steps to ensure that AI-generated content complies with copyright 
 laws. When users interact with AI-driven systems, they should be fully informed about 
 how their data is utilized and what kind of content is being generated. Respecting user 
 consent and their rights is critical for maintaining trust and adhering to legal 
 requirements. To stay compliant and reduce legal risks, organizations must stay 
 updated about these developments and adapt their practices accordingly to ensure they 
 partake in regulatory compliance and avoid any future issues. As generative AI 
 continues to grow, it can lead to concerns about possible job displacement. Ethical 
 considerations come into play regarding how organizations manage workforce 
 transitions and provide opportunities for affected employees to receive training and 
 reskilling. To tackle these legal and ethical challenges effectively, organizations should 
 establish clear policies and guidelines for the responsible utilization of generative AI. 
 This includes implementing measures to mitigate bias, enhance transparency, and

In terms of copyright, AI generated content might unknowingly disregard copyrights or trademarks. Additionally, I saw a post on Reddit discussing how determining ownership and liability for AI generated content can be complex and might lead to legal issues. This user’s post introduces an important question of asking how copyright can be protected and believed if an individual were to claim something as theirs. Additionally, generative AI must ensure it doesn’t plagiarize existing work, especially in organizational settings where workers may use AI to write reports, ads, or papers. 
	Additionally, generative AI may raise ethical issues with its impact on jobs in terms of job displacement. Generative AI can automate repetitive tasks such as data entry, content generation, and basic levels of customer service which could possibly force some human employees in given fields to lose their job or get transferred to more complex tasks. A user on Reddit raised a great question asking how economies can grow if AI replaces jobs because if people aren’t being paid, it can’t stimulate a growing economy. Although I don’t think this will happen for a long time, it’s still a little terrifying, yet interesting to think about.

Some of the ethical issues could consist of using generative AI to steal or use other people’s ideas or inventions. I think intellectual property theft could be a huge issue when you use generative AI with some of the human elements.

For one instance, there can be an issue surrounding the generation of content that may closely resemble that of copyrighted work. There are currently not any clear guidelines or policies that are implemented to help prevent this from happening. Additionally, another concern is that while the use of generative AI can help bring more information to the masses, it can also cause the spread of misinformation and the manipulation of existing information. For instance, someone could use generative AI to create a voice recording of a higher up saying something inappropriate even if that boss had never actually said that. This concern continues to grow as generative AI continues to get better and more convincing every day. Another concern is that if used in an organizational setting, there will be questions of privacy and security that come into play as that data will be the foundation of what the generative AI will be trained on. The security/privacy on this innovation also needs to be touched on. As there is much good that comes out of this innovation, there are still many concerns that come along as well."
905,S0265,3,"There are many different legal and ethical issues that arise from the generative AI in an organized setting. Plagiarism is one of the main ones because it may provide copyright that a user may not notice. Copying and pasting a source used in AI into a specific workplace, school, or anywhere else could get users in a lot of trouble. Therefore, this is one of the biggest legal issues that could take place when using generative AI. Another legal and ethical issue mentioned in the post I am referencing is bias and fairness, which explains that there are sometimes cases that occur in which discriminatory or biased responses will appear. This could cause a lot of issues as well, and I thought it was very interesting how this was brought up because with Chat-GPT I never thought of this being an issue. The AI generator is so technologically advanced that it would say anything without the control of anyone. Another example, is in a job setting, using AI and not using it properly in the workplace could lead to job displacement.

906,S0266,3,"Using generative AI in organizations comes with signiﬁcant legal and ethical
considerations. We must consider who owns the ideas it generates, how it affects
people's privacy, and whether its content is biased. There's also a worry about misusing
it, like making fake videos for harmful reasons. To handle these issues, organizations
must follow rules and guidelines to use generative AI responsibly and openly. One big
concern is who owns the things that generative AI creates like pictures, videos, or text. A
lot of creative artists like singers were getting their voices used to create new songs or
sing new songs that weren’t theirs. This scared people as it can take away the creativity
from the art. We also have to be careful because the AI might accidentally make things
that are unfair or show favoritism. Plus, there's a real risk of people misusing it, like
creating fake videos to trick or hurt others. To tackle these challenges, organizations
must understand and follow the laws and rules, making sure they use generative AI in a
way that's responsible and clear. This isn't just about following the law but it's also
about building trust with everyone involved. By being careful and open, organizations
can make the most of generative AI while avoiding problems and treating people fairly."
907,S0267,3,"When it comes to AI, there are a few legal and ethical issues that can arise.  For one,

really know what companies use in order to train their AI so making sure this doesn’t happen 
can prove to be difficult.  Another big concern is copyright infringement and intellectual 
property.  Since the AI really does not have a moral code nor does it understand breaking laws, 
it may produce content that is copyrighted and owned  by someone.  If someone unknowingly 
uses this, they may get in big trouble without even realizing it.  Tracing this content back to its 
original creator can be complicated.  Users of AI also have to watch out for bias and 
discrimination as well.  If the AI is trained on biased material, then the AI will produce biased 
results.  If someone is unaware of this, then they may be misled and given misinformation.  It is 
important that people are aware of what the AI was trained on in order to avoid being misled 
by an accident. "
908,S0268,3,"Currently, the legal issues that arise from generative AI stand in what can be considered a ‘gray
area' within the legal system. Due to the nature of how AI generated images are generated, it is
rather difficult to precisely pinpoint where the line between human and AI generated content
stands on the topic of copyright. Some AI generation tools allow for the creator to own both the
prompts and images that are generated; however, the unknown nature of which reference
images were used in the creation of such images could become susceptible to copyright laws.
This creates confusion when trying to apply copyright law since it was written to protect
human-made creations, which AI generated images can argue that they are, yet this raises
another question of what happens when AI generation softwares completes the majority of the
work on an image. Because of this, organizations have the opportunity to use generative AI and
unless it bears a very striking resemblance to an artist's work, there are no legal issues. This
does not mean that there are also no ethical issues to consider in an organizational setting.
Such ethical issues in an organizational setting pertain to privacy concerns, biases, and lack of
transparency. Additionally, because of the lack of transparency, organizations will be more than
happy to acquire data for their datasets however method they can, ethical or not."

So. After understanding and reflecting upon these seven points, I believe to explain in my own words the legal and ethical challenges organizations face. To begin with, organizations are run by people, people who rely on employment to make a living, there exists a large degree of unpredictability regarding this technology which leaves employees anxious and pessimistic about generative AI’s future as it may threaten their employment. Additionally, how do you explain the decisions you make when using such a complicated piece of technology? Every action has its consequences, and the affected party will demand to know what happened, why and what the reasoning was. This segways into , in my opinion, the two most critical aspects, which are labor and “Big Data”. How do you ensure that labor is being treated with legal and ethical respect and that the collection of data is done in a legal and ethical manner? I believe there must be a set of rules and reasoning that governing bodies must enforce to protect the rights, employment , privacy, and reputation of everyone, it must be universally agreed upon, simple to understand, and dynamic enough to include the breakneck speed of development of this amazing technology. There are many more, but these are just some issues that these organizations face when using generative ai.

910,S0270,3,"Of course, AI has potential ethical and legal issues. The concept is dependent on information that has been uploaded to the program to produce content. Therefore, users of AI run the risk of violating intellectual property rights and copyright infringement. It is imperative that companies relying on AI to produce content ensure anything that is officially published by them is void of plagiarism prior to its release. Additionally, the data that feeds the content created by AI may be biased. Generative programs do not conduct research the same way humans do. It relies on the existing data and produces results based on readily available resources. If a creator were to upload data that aligned solely with political or religious parties, the AI naturally would produce answers, content, and suggestions that correspond with its respective group. One last potential issue of AI is the ethical sourcing of information used as inputs. Generative AI needs lots of information for training data, a dataset used as the learning mechanism for AI to recognize patterns and perform tasks based on set criteria. This means that the large amount of data needed for machine learning is obtained without consent. This is a serious issue and needs to be considered before data mining users without regard to their privacy and knowledge. "

These can create concerns because if an organization or worker relies too heavily on AI it could show the worker does not have the proper qualifications to complete their job. This would allow the AI to produce work that may not be quality-checked leading into the next issue. The reliability issue of some AI. AI that is not properly taught could create false information or may not be able to give credit to where the information came from. As we know copyright issues could come into play if proper credit is not given to AI information. With AI being a fairly new technology there is not much in the way of legal precedent. However, not too long ago there was a hearing with the U.S. Congress and Open AI’s CEO. One of the key takeaways I got from reading an analysis is that with few AI laws already in place it raises concerns that major corporations will be the ones to write all the laws on AI."
913,S0273,3,"This subreddit was also very helpful for this question. At first, I thought about possible copyright infringements. This could be a big issue especially in the business world. User “u/Total_Ad_1714” mentioned something very interesting, they said “AI can pose as a false hope for people solely relying on generative AI to create work.” This is very true, although generative AI can be a massive help in gaining information, it cannot be your only source. Companies have to pay close attention to the information they are using from ChatGPT and other generative AI sources. If they don’t, the organization could end up and legal trouble. Like I said, the subreddit was a huge help for this question, while I knew there is always a possibility for legal and ethical issues while using generative AI, I couldn’t pinpoint the exact issues at hand. The subreddit helped me out and helped me gain a ton of new information on this topic. Overall, I learned that copyright infringements can come from using AI, I also learned that if you rely on AI as a sole source, you could be in for some trouble. "
914,S0274,3,"When dealing with AI in an organizational environment there are a number of legal
and ethical issues associated, some include the integrity of AI as AI is unable to differentiate between fact
and bias. This leads their decisions to be susceptible to information that is inaccurate. Another reason is
that AI brings out concerns of fundamental values and basic human rights, this is due to the fact that AIs
can create and replicate human behavior. This can cause great risk as some individuals may use voice
recognition technology which can replicate others and by using this technology gain an advantage over
individuals who become more susceptible when hearing for example a loved one although it’s an AI. This
is not only possible in voice recognition but also in mimicking human behavior in the sense of displaying a
loved one’s face and movements. Risks like these are not the only ones, there are also risks of privacy
and many AI technologies are able to record and gather data on individuals without their consent also
jeopardizing their rights. Lastly, AIs pose a threat to the lack of transparency. As many AI decisions are
based on programming which is likely to run into issues that are not easily seen, this can cause their
decisions to not line up with what humans want."
915,S0275,3,"There is a reddit post about this topic that links to a blog post written about legal and ethical issues with AI. According to the article this topic does not have a definite right answer. Ai and the surrounding technology is so new that people are still unsure what the issues fall under, ethical or legal. The main issue of this comes out of image creation. Because the Ai learns from already created data, it learns from pictures that have already been made by artists. Thus the ai learns to generate images in a very similar style as that artist. This brings in issues legally of copyright laws.   
Another problem is that the Ai is not human, so it does not understand sensitive topics. With no feeling about what topics are sensitive and what aren’t the AI causes ethical issues entailed within writing and image creation.

916,S0276,3,"A few lawful and moral issues that are related with generative man-made intelligence are:
1.	Algorithmic Predisposition and Separation: Generative AI models can sustain predispositions that are available in information and that can prompt unfair results. This frequently prompts lawful activity and impeding harm to one's standing. Association should effectively attempt to distinguish and alleviate predisposition in their AI frameworks.
2.	Intellectual Property Privileges: Associations should go through the mind-boggling scene of licensed innovation while utilizing generative AI. Inquiries of possession can come up when Generative AI intelligence produces inventive works and legitimate questions can come to fruition over creation and copyright issues.
3.	Accountability and risk: Figuring out who is answerable for content that was created by AI can challenge. Associations ought to make clear lines of responsibility and consider obligation structures to address possible damage or blunders.
4.	Transparency and Interpretability: The straightforwardness of Generative AI intelligence manifestations can be a lawful or even a moral concern. Guidelines might expect associations to give clarifications to Generative AI driven choices, particularly those in fields like money and medical services.
5.	Ethical Use and Plan: Ensuring that man-made intelligence is utilized for moral objects is an unquestionable requirement. Associations ought to lay out rules to forestall destructive use or the formation of hostile substance.
6.	Consumer Trust and Notoriety: Abusing Generative AI intelligence or having exploitative substance because of man-made intelligence can prompt the deficiency of purchaser trust. Following moral man-made intelligence standards can safeguard an association's standing and keep up with partner trust.

917,S0277,3,"Ethical and legal issues arise from the sources AI innovations come from. More specifically, when AI creates a new image, it references other images online without giving credit to the source the image was inspired by. This is a copyright infringement as it steals pieces of the original source and claiming the new piece as entirely innovative and one of a kind with is not true. Plagiarism is the most common lawsuit in regard to generative AI as it is difficult to finds the sources used to create these innovations. One specific lawsuit regarding plagiarism within generative AI was against Microsoft, OpenAI, and GitHub. The code produced had already been written by someone else. 
An ethical issue that arises from generative AI is where their training data comes from. Often times generative AI can be biased from the training data used. Generative AI can also have misinformation and can be malicious as well as spread fake news or spam. AI models can be unpredictable, complex, hard to verify, or difficult to regulate outputs. There is also a lack of privacy and security which poses the risk of data protection, confidentiality, and consent. Unfortunately, AI consumes a large number of resources and energy impacting the environment in harmful ways.

918,S0278,3,"In the organizational setting, there are a number of legal and ethical issues that can turn up while using generative AI for certain purposes. Legally, AI has the issues of data privacy and intellectual property being stolen/misused. It is unclear how closely AI will follow regulations and legal proceedings, especially when data transcends national boundaries and laws. For ethical reasons, issues arise for a couple of reasons. One such reason being model bias, which are errors that can occur during the machine learning phase where the AI is pulling data and be fed misleading information and can detriment the results and efficiency of the AI generations.

919,S0279,3,"Generative AI is a very powerful tool, and with its ability to help users with assignments and projects, this tool can also be abused. ChatGPT is a model of generative AI, which allows users to ask questions. Users can ask things that will aid their work, for example when a certain event took place. They can also input the prompt to an essay they need for a class, where the model will create an essay based off of the prompt given. This ability brings up questions of not only plagiarism and copyright, but also intellectual property. AI models like ChatGPT are not fully able to be 100 percent copyright free. They may use existing essays that have answered similar questions, and the essay produced will then be susceptible to copyright infringement. Some may even argue if it is ethical to use generative AI in this way. One example of this concerns artwork. Generative AI can produce artwork that has a styling similar to existing artwork that was created by a human. This brings up the question of intellectual property, and who really owns rights to what was produced. There is still a lot to be learned about generative AI and what it can do, so it is important that organizations develop clear policies and guidelines as to how AI-generated content is used. "
920,S0280,3," With the rise of generative AI, there are a lot of concerns about legal and ethical
issues. One Reddit user made a comment about the recent writers’ strike, which led to people
wondering if generative AI can be used in different ways to replace human creativity. Generative
AI is able to produce images, scripts, and characters for entertainment that would replace many
jobs from photographers/videographers, writers, actors, and more. This also goes into copyright
issues and brings up the question of whether AI-generated content will be copyrighted and how
that will affect the way people use AI. Even outside of the entertainment industry, there are
worries that AI can cause ethical risks and harm in other organizations by releasing private data
or any sensitive information that is a risk to safety and security. Another concern about AI is the
possibility of replacing many jobs in order to automate them and make them more efficient;
however, if AI replaces many jobs in a corporation, many people will be unemployed and have
no money to spend, which would impact the economy negatively. If AI were to replace corporate
jobs, it may not happen instantaneously, but there would be an impact on the economy and the
population over time, which is an ethical issue to keep in mind when talking about generative AI."

922,S0282,3,"3.	When generative AI generates content using personal data, privacy concerns develop. Organizations must follow data protection standards. Legal difficulties may result from how data is obtained, and ethical issues can emerge from model bias caused by the type of data utilized in training. Data privacy, intellectual property, and biases in AI-generated material are all legal and ethical considerations. Organizations must manage rules, preserve data, and deal with AI-generated content that is potentially inaccurate. Job security is a topic that is prevalent now. This could result in people losing their jobs, getting laid off, and financial instability. To prevent this, businesses need to create a strategy to ensure workers utilize AI to boost performance and efficiency. Several AIs are programmed for certain algorithms and biased data, which may result in biased outcomes, leading to workplace discrimination and inequality. If the organization incorporates AI into the algorithm, it will need to be trained on fair and diverse data . "
923,S0283,3,"AI-generated content may reproduce copyrighted material or closely resemble existing work and how this can be stopped is tough.  Organizations must avoid plagiarism and copyright infringement or there can be legal consequences. Another issue of Generative AI models is often using many datasets that can include individuals personal information. Organizations need to ensure that their use of AI complies with data privacy regulations and copyright regulations. These include organizations like GDPR or CCPA, and that they do not inadvertently generate or share confidential information.The GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation and it is an EU regulation for the data protection and privacy of EU residents. The CCPA stands for California Consumer Privacy Act and it is a US state law to protect the data and privacy rights of residents. To make it more complex, every state has its own rules and legal loopholes. I foresee AI being a big topic in the legal world and many lawyers specializing in AI cases. I feel this task is so hard considering there is countless information on the web to filter that is hard using AI. Soon I feel there will be filters put out there that will make it easier for companies to freely utilize AI. Until then I feel organizations that are utilizing AI will need to have a team to closely monitor what information AI is using to come up with their output. If this is not monitored I foresee lawsuits or legal action considering lots of personal information or copyright regulations can be violated. "
924,S0284,3,"The legal and ethical issues associated with generative AI in organizational settings include the potential risk of and presence of privacy and security concerns, creation and spread of misinformation, concerns regarding ownership rights, the potential for harmful generated content, and/or bias and discrimination. An article from Maryville University addresses the concern of data collection and digital footprints from our phones and social media platforms as it relates to search engines, employment practices, and organizational tools. For instance, Generative AI can collect, store, predict, and analyze the information from various sources and use it for unethical or illegal practices such as data mining for profit to other companies, targeted marketing tactics that source from information collected that individuals may not wish to be disclose or if the information is accessed or sold without users giving their consent. The University’s article also explains the impact of biases within generative AI models that reflect biases that exist through human behaviors or sources previously made. Since such models are trained to gather data that already exists and utilize it for new or improved methods, the generated work may contain bias. It is imperative for organizations that utilize AI to form and implement efficient strategies to also understand and work against the legal and ethical issues that arise from generative AI."
925,S0285,3,"There are a lot of major issues associated with generative AI, for example, personal data
is used a lot in AI-generated content. One user also stated that there can be a lot of bias in
AI-generated content, which could be an issue since the AI is being fed information from all over
the world and can be fed harmful information. One reason I am worried about AI being in an
organizational setting is that if I was looking over someone's budget sheet, the company could
not afford some of the answers to be incorrect because of the internal revenue code. Another
legal issue is a lot of content being stolen or reused without consent. One example is the
entertainment companies using deep fakes that can mimic popular artists or musicians' styles.
Some songs that were made by AI and sound like popular artists are even making top music
charts. An article by Joren Verspeurt stated that popular image generators have been shown to
reinforce harmful biases and have also received backlash from other artists who had their work
mimicked without their permission. Organizations have to be cautious and may get in trouble
and risk their reputation. There is a lot of opportunity with generated AI and organizations can
learn a lot from it shortly."
926,S0286,3,"There are several arguments surrounding the legal issues faced by AI. One of the reddit posts found on the community board is about how AI can face legal issues by being trained on copyrighted material. The legal issue with this is that when AI is trained under copywritten material it poses a concern about how that material is copied and distributed. AI is able to share and distribute this material which causes an issue for the original creator because who have the exclusive right to copy and share their work. This could be an issue as the AI runs the risk of violating copyright laws. On the more ethical side of this is the concern that AI is taking over creative jobs and roles. AI is able to quickly and effectively create new artwork, music, movies, and anything that can be written into a prompt. This is an ethical issue because AI can destroy human creativity and cultural diversity in art. The users of AI must be careful in how they use AI in creative work and make rules/guidelines for how AI will be used in the creative field. The balance between AI art and human art has to be found in order to not destroy human creativity as AI’s role in art grows. "

928,S0288,3,"There are many legal and ethical issues associated with generative AI in organizational settings especially since it has grown so big so fast recently. We have begun seeing issues with content creators such as screen writers and artists beginning to complain about AI taking away from their jobs. This even came up in the SAG-AFTRA strikes where they were looking to negotiate that AI cannot be used by the producers to change or replace what the writers come up with. They also looked to negotiate that AI can’t be used to build off of what the writers do. This is because if it is used, who is the credit for the script given to, the writers or a robot? Another huge issue is data privacy, since generative AI requires a lot of data input to produce accurate results and that data would come from the everyday consumer there are many concerns for data leaks. The last issue is if the company is getting accurate results back from the AI. AI is not always the most accurate since it pulls from many sources and creates its own rendition, so if a business owner looked up how to file a specific form and gets the answer back incorrectly it could lead to some legal issues with the paperwork.

930,S0290,3,"On Reddit user Total_Ad_1714 states “There are many legal and ethical issues surrounding generative AI. Ranging from copyright, intellectual property, and creativity, generative AI can pose as a false hope for people relying solely on generative AI to create work.” The landscape of generative AI presents a complex tapestry of legal and ethical challenges, notably in the realms of copyright, intellectual property, and creativity. The autonomy of generative AI introduces intricate questions surrounding ownership and attribution of creative outputs, necessitating a careful alignment with existing legal frameworks to ensure due recognition for creators. Beyond legal complexities, ethical concerns come to the forefront as reliance on generative AI for creative work can foster a misguided sense of creativity. Relying solely on AI for artistic and intellectual endeavors raises questions about authenticity and the meaningful contribution of human creativity. Ethical considerations stress the importance of maintaining human involvement in the creative process to preserve genuine artistic expression. This makes it so there needs to be a balance that is made by people who uphold the integrity of both human creativity and leveraging the potential of generative AI."
931,S0291,3,"Obviously, ChatGPT gave me a long-winded list of answers to my question which is very helpful, especially if I needed several specific points rather than a vague answer. To summarize, ChatGPT thinks that Intellectual property and copyright, bias and fairness, privacy, misinformation and fake news, transparency and accountability, lack of human oversight, job displacement, security risks, regulatory compliance, and ethical use and accountability are the top ten legal and ethical issues that may arise in AI. I thought that job displacement was very spot on because many people, especially graphic designers have felt threatened that their jobs will be overtaken by AI, but I heard someone say, “AI won’t take our jobs, people who can use AI can take our jobs.” This was very scary because people who have spent hours and years at school, learning, and creating can so easily be displaced from their jobs by someone who has learned to use generative AI to their advantage. As far as legal and ethical issues there are many, but like I mentioned in question 2, the deepfakes people have been making are scary and they are even creating pornographic content with celebrities' and influencers' faces. This is a complete invasion of privacy—celebrity or not."
932,S0292,3,"The most compelling answer I found regarding the ethics regarding generative AI is if the generative AI uses historical social data in order to predict the future and then provides responses regarding that.Some examples include loan algorithms and predictive policing. The reason why it is unethical is because all datasets with historical social data have implicit bias. While the outcomes it will produce will coincide with what the past has shown, it won't necessarily allow for any changes to occur, and in turn cause even larger societal divides. Another legal problem regarding AI is identity theft. AI can already mimic celebrities' voices, so with enough data, AI will be able to mimic anyone’s voices, signatures and such. If that happens, the whole idea of accounting controls and ethics gets thrown out of the window. People could potentially use AI to mimic those who are meant to approve payroll, or expense reports, and get away with theft from a company, or a particularly evil company can do the same to “get” customers who never wanted to sign up for anything in the first place. Finally, AI can be used to establish further control over people. If a company doesn’t want their employees to do something, they could have an AI police system that could constantly monitor everything and instantly report, even if its something like looking up other jobs."
933,S0293,3,"-	I was not able to find any discussions on the possible legal or ethical issues about using Generative AI in an organizational setting on my chosen Online Knowledge Community and chosen sub-community, but I am able to come up with possible problems on my own.
One ethical issue that has already arised is the concern about Generative AI creating visual art. There are two points to the argument that is against Generative AI creating visual art. One point is that Generative AI uses resources of already existing copyrighted artwork, views and studies them using its intelligence, and creates artwork on its own. This can be seen as violating the copyrighted work of art and essentially “copying it.” Another point that people who are against it make is that it is almost morally wrong. Generative AI are not artists and are not people, so therefore people say that the art it creates is not genuine and not true art. It does not come from the feelings or thoughts of a true artist.
Another ethical issue is that Generative AI can be used to slash the labor force. If AI continues to grow in the direction it is going, there will be little use for software engineers and graphic designers at some point, because Generative AI can produce most of those things. However, you can argue that the quality of work that it produces is not as sharp as a person who is experienced and trained.
"
934,S0294,3,"In organizational settings, Generative AI brings forth a host of legal and ethical concerns that demand careful attention. For one, intellectual property rights can become in question when AI generates content. Organizations must grapple with considerations like who owns AI-generated materials and what rights creators and users hold over them. This becomes particularly complex when AI is used to develop creative works, such as artwork, music, or literature. Copyright laws, traditionally designed for human authors will require reformulation to account for AI's creative contributions.
Another ethical concern is related to bias and fairness. Generative AI models are often trained on large datasets, which may contain biases present in the data. When AI is used in organizational decision-making processes, such as hiring or lending, these biases can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing inequalities. Ensuring that AI systems are fair and free from discrimination is essential to uphold ethical standards and promote social justice. There have already been several instances of the AI racial profiling people with darker skin complexion so this is a critical error that must be addressed.
Additionally, privacy is also a significant ethical concern. Generative AI can synthesize highly realistic content, including deepfake videos and fabricated text. This raises the risk of misuse for deceptive purposes, leading to concerns about misinformation and privacy violations. Striking a balance between innovation and ethical boundaries in content generation is vital to safeguarding trust in organizational settings. To navigate these legal and ethical issues, organizations must establish clear policies and guidelines for the use of generative AI by insisting on incorporating principles of fairness, transparency, and accountability. In conclusion, collaboration between legal experts, ethicists, and technologists is crucial to developing useful frameworks that address these multitude of challenges while still harnessing the benefits of generative AI for organizational advancement.

935,S0295,3,"Legal and ethical issues will be that AI is not integrated with the policies and rules of each company, meaning that the information gathered from the AI systems could be incorrect pertaining to the companies. In addition, AI generates information from multiple websites that are not fact checked by the government. The information could not be hundred percent correct or legal. Another major issue can be that AI can be easily accessible for hackers to obtain personal data/information from the companies, clients, or even customers. Organizations should make sure that they have data protection regulations, and make sure the information is anonymized to prevent hackers attacks. Since the AI generator is fed information from all types of websites it could be receiving biased opinions of others. Receiving biased information from others serves a question on how ethically correct a statement made by AI can be. Humans have the ability to dignify whether or not something is biased. AI does not have the capability of identifying whether or not a statement is made based on a biased opinion of someone. Ethical statements are made by maintaining high standards of truthful actions and words. People are able to transpire truthful values and morals of a company's motives. AI does not have the capabilities as a human does to view and understand ethics. This could potentially lead to a negative outcome if a company relies purely on an AI generation. "
936,S0296,3,There are most definitely legal and ethical issues associated with generative AI in organization settings. A really ethical issue that I know of is art AIs. These are AIs that can create digital art. Now this doesn't sound bad but the art that a lot of these AIs have been trained on was made by professional artists who were not asked permission to use their art to train the AI. This means the AI is using art from real artists without their consent and creating new images based on those artists’ designs. The question then becomes it is really unethical. Because the designs are technically “new” because they are generated by using a combination of many arts together to create something “new”. Legally there is a chance that an AI can break copyright laws. Lets say a short story AI writer writes a story but the story produced is extremely similar to a story that already exists. It is possible for that story to infringe on the copyright of the book or short story that the generated content was based on. The chances of this are obviously small but it is all possible with generative AI since there are so many ways you can ask a generative AI to generate content. Because the area of generative AI is so innovative and new only time will tell what the legal issues will look like.

For organizational level, in my own perspective, AI can be a potential risk for large corporates if not used properly. State of Italy banned the usage of Chat GPT. Italian Data Protection Authority said Chat GPT was violating the European Union’s strict General Data Protection Regulation in multiple ways.

	Generative AI may include sensitive or personal information because of its large dataset. Organizations must comply with data privacy regulations when using AI just in case they inadvertently generate or share confidential information.
	Organizations may also encounter ownership issues with generated content. For instance, who will be the owner of the generated content when AI creates the work? This will be more problematic when it comes to commercial objectives.
	AI-generated content may unknowingly be regarded as plagiarism and intimately corresponding to existing work. Companies must enhance their legal awareness issues to avoid that infringement, which could result in consequences in law.
 	Ethical issues: Discrimination and fairness and misinformation and manipulation.
	This AI model can lead to an era of biased or discriminating content due to the ability to learn predispositions in its data. Using AI intentionally to create discriminatory information to attack someone’s reputation personally could lead to ethical issues or worsen legal claims.
	People could use generative AI to spread misinformation or participate in adversarial exercises such as making fake videotapes or exploiting words to mislead people. Companies should establish policies to prevent the misuse of AI’s power.

939,S0299,3,"Generative AIs are rapidly being created and developed. With AI being able to create almost anything from texts, images, videos, sounds, and more, there are some concerns on whether or not some of the AI-generated responses are legal and/or ethical. “OpenAI” on Reddit has a user ask if it good to use AI to help them write an essay for an English class and whether it can be detected as AI-generated and plagiarism (Salamander-Left, 2023) There are many Reddit users providing solutions to this problem like changing the wording of some the essay so it can pass automated plagiarism checking systems like TurnItIn.com. Others suggested using certain AIs that are better at writing essays like Textero.ai. This is an issue that many institutions are facing. People are cutting down time when working on school work or work assignments and not actually creating the work themselves. Due to AI using other existing data to create new data, this can pose a problem with plagiarism since work cannot be cited or information can be wrong. When asking Chat GPT on what are the legal and ethical issues with generative AI, it explains how intellectual property rights can be violated and copyright infringement and how people and organizations can unknowingly violate those rights.
	Another AI legal issue has been generated photos of real people. In the “facepalm” subreddit, a video was reuploaded from another SMP of a woman who has had her photos from her SMP profiles uploaded to an AI and it generated fake nude photos of her and it was sent to her by an anonymous user. She later made a video explaining that this can happen which later went viral and had more people harassing her asking her to post the real photos. (ohwellwho, 2023) The woman felt violated and as if her real photos were leaked.

While this is just one issue, it raises a fundamental question about AI replacing humans in the workforce. Additionally, it addresses the topic of whether the practice of using an AI chatbot should be disclosed to customers or not. The ethics of using AI-powered customer service bots without disclosure hinge on transparency and honesty. It is generally considered ethically responsible to inform customers if they interact with a bot rather than a human, as this sets clear expectations and respects their autonomy. Transparency helps prevent deception and ensures that customers can make informed decisions about how they engage with the service. However, there may be scenarios where disclosing the use of AI bots is unnecessary, such as when the interaction is brief and transactional. Still, balancing efficiency and transparency is essential while respecting customer trust and consent.

941,S0301,3,"     As this is a growing technology that will continue to grow smarter and do unimaginable things, there is a great concern for possible legal and ethical issues. This is still new as well so new rules and guidelines are being created and will continue to develop as this technology improves over time. Many big concerns revolve around privacy, security, accountability, and misinformation. 
     To get into the legality of privacy and security of such a intelligent technology like generative AI, some of the information being used by these neural networks can be sensitive or personal. There are many rules and guidelines that these systems must follow to protect people’s information, but some people still feel uncomfortable knowing that there is a possibility their information is being used. Because these AI networks also hold vulnerable information, this makes it at high risk of cyber-attacks. There are plenty of measures that are taken in order to prevent these attacks but not everything will be full proof forever. Just like AI is growing so is the intelligence of criminals trying to hack into these types of systems. 
     When it comes to ethical issues regarding AI, people can be too trusting when it comes to information outputted by these systems or not trusting when it comes to these systems. With this technology being able to replicate voices and images it can also pose a huge threat to society as well.

943,S0303,3,"There are multiple legal and ethical issues associated with generative AI in organizational settings that are complex and multifaceted. Generative AI may inadvertently produce content that closely resembles copyrighted materials, leading to potential copyright infringement issues. Mostly, generative AI might inadvertently generate designs or inventions that infringe on existing patents. Organizations should be cautious when using AI-generated designs in product development. Generative models can learn biases present in their training data, leading to the generation of biased content. This can perpetuate stereotypes or discriminate against certain groups. Ethical concerns arise when AI-generated content is biased or unfair. Organizations must actively work to mitigate bias and ensure fairness in AI-generated content. This may involve careful data selection, algorithmic fairness testing, and ongoing monitoring. Generative AI may use personal data to create content, which can raise privacy concerns. Organizations must adhere to data protection regulations when using personal data in AI systems. Ensuring the security of the data used to train and operate generative AI models is crucial. Unauthorized access to AI-generated content or the underlying data can result in data breaches. If generative AI systems interact with users or generate content on their behalf, organizations should consider obtaining clear and informed consent from users. Generative AI can be used to create forged documents, images, or videos, raising concerns about misinformation, fraud, and cybersecurity threats. Organizations must comply with relevant laws and regulations governing AI use, data protection, consumer rights, and intellectual property in their jurisdiction and the jurisdictions they operate in. Organizations using generative AI should proactively address these legal and ethical concerns through rigorous compliance measures, ethical AI guidelines, ongoing monitoring, and responsible AI development practices. Collaboration with legal experts, data ethicists, and regulators can also be valuable in navigating the complex landscape of generative AI ethics and legality."
944,S0304,3,"The most important Legal issues is copyright infringement and intellectual property. The view on generative AI is still being litigated as most recently there was a hearing on how to legislate A. The most valuable thing to companies in today’s age is data. Protecting their data is their top priority since data is what is driving the future markets. Using Paint to train AI is an ethical issue itself since it’s being trained on the painter’s artwork to replicate a better image taking away from the actional painter work which can cause him to loss out on money from the sell and distribution of painting. Using data without permission is an issue take tesla their not a car company that builds electric cars that’s part of it but the main purpose of tesla is self-driving vehicle and their leading the innovations in that space by how much data they collect form their user and how much data them self-have accumulate is what has made tesla a super power it is today. Every day they get close to autonomous  driving which mean their able to sell their software  to car company which through licensing is where their going to make their majority of money from and all that come from collecting data which Generative AI need to be able to produce the content it is trained for. So, the legal issue is data scraping since it’s going to websites and taking their data without any type of exchange. "
945,S0305,3,"However advantages generative AI might be it also comes with possible ethical and legal issues. Some organizational setting issues may arise from creating fake content for credit, copyrights and possible fradulent activity. As with anything that has great power, we must ensure that we are responsible users of this technology. An organization may have serious issues with data privacy and security if their generative AI is not used responsibly. Generative AI and its ability to create new content can be a dangerous thing and create copyright legal issues. When an organization makes the decision to implement generative AI into their business operations it has taken the huge responsibility to ensure that this generative AI is free of any bias treating people with respect and providing fair service to everyone. After all, generative AI is a machine that has no feelings. I can definitely see how generative AI can cause many lawsuits against organizations that are not responsible enough to correctly code this technology to make sure it provides a fair and biased free experience for all customers. For organizations where large amounts of personal sensitive data is used the risk is higher to make sure that this generative AI has excellent privacy controls as well as security. Generative AI can be used to an advantage for many however the humans must stay in control and make sure that the technology is properly coded for the business operations of each individual company. Failure to do so may result in the opposite end goal, high cost in legal fees, customer dissatisfaction, employee retention issues and profit loss. "
946,S0306,3,"There are certainly legal and ethical issues associated with using generative AI in an organizational setting. One of which is the ability to create false and misleading content that may trick the viewer. An organization should always take care not to spread misinformation.
Another ethical issue that may be problematic for users of generative AI is an inherent bias that could be learned by the program during its training phase. These biases may present discriminatory responses which may harm others. This can be especially prevalent when using generative AI for processes such as hiring.
An ethical issue that I heard about recently while speaking with my spouse was that of a court case in which a deposition submitted by a couple attorneys was generated via ChatGPT. The product of their prompt had cited a source that was actually fictitious. The attorneys did not verify the accuracy of these sources and submitted their document to the courts. When the judge realized what had happened, he fined each attorney $50,000.    
"
947,S0307,3,"	With the rapidly evolving abilities and uses of generative AI, there are many legal and ethical issues and concerns that organizations must consider. Recent lawsuits have centered around the use of generative AI creating art derived from human artists and whether such works should attribute credit to the humans who created the content that the generative AI pulled from. Because generative AI systems lack the ability for true originality or “inspiration” as we define it for humans, there is a valid argument for these claims. Generative AI only reiterates the information it is fed, and is it fair for companies to use these tools to recreate without consequence or due credit what others have made? And what of the artist? Generative AI scrapes data from the internet (or whatever input it’s given). Does the artist consent to their works being scraped in the first place to become the derivative property of a user or company? In most instances, no.
	Another ethical and legal issue is the displacement of workers with increased generative AI integrations in the workplace. The impact would expand beyond the organization to society, and organizations do have an inherent responsibility to avoid operating in ways that would be a detriment to their communities. Within organizations, what would the consequences be of replacing managers with generative AI models and assigning tasks to supervise or review the work of humans? This could potentially create equity issues as organizations would have to label the value of generative AI productivity against their human workforce. We already see that in the form of layoffs in some industries.

"
948,S0308,3,"After doing my research on reditt theirs many legal and ethical issues that can be associated with AI. The first one being plagiarism. Since theirs a chance the work can be copyrighted even though AI’s goal is to avoid it. Theirs still a very high chance that this can happen. Another one can be data and privacy issues. It requires and holds a ton of information and if not handled the right way or secured enough it can leak  personal data. It also can give you misleading data as well. The can be very bias as someone can use and abuse AI and it can spread around false information on the internet. Since all of these things can happen it can cause many ethical and legal issues when it comes to AI. It can be hard to tell if information is real and that’s why it’s important to do your research other than just relying on AI since it’s not always 100% accurate. You should always double check your sources. Theirs still more positives than negatives to AI but you never want find yourself in a sticky situation. Your company couls be respnosble for AI leaking their information and you could face legal issues.

"
949,S0309,3,"Even though generative AI can be an innovative tool in an organizational setting, there can be some legal and ethical issues that come into play. As I mentioned before, this tool can be used for content creation. However, without further editing and proofreading, this can easily lead to plagiarism. According to an article on AI Multiple, another issue that generative AI can lead to is the risk of employees losing their jobs (Dilmegani). This is a common concern within the world of AI, it produces loads of content that humans can do but in a click of a button. This issue has been a hot topic since the rise of AI generated images and videos. Which has concerned artists and creatives regarding the demand of their work. A legal issue that can arise is data security and privacy issues. Based on Arent Fox Schiff Law’s article, confidentiality is very important within an organization. It advises others to always use tools to adhere to data security and confidentiality before utilizing the data (Glynn, Schneider, and Jasnow). Since this tool can consume a large amount of data there can be a high possibility causing privacy issues. 
Based on the response I received, data ownership can be a concern. The models that are created are scraped up by multiple different sources on the internet. I see why others may find that this can be an ethical issue if their data is being used without permission. However, whenever a person does upload something online, anyone can do what they want to it.
"
950,S0310,3,"Using and interacting with generative AI presents many ethical and legal obstacles that if not taken seriously could lead to complications down the line. Some being legitimacy, credibility to name a few. One issue that arises a few times pertains to privacy concerns. Generative AI process all data available to the public. In some grey areas that could also include personal information that was obtained without the user actually realizing they had allowed or given consent for their information to be used, as such this could create legal repercussion to an organization if used that would negatively impact the user. Continuing with the subject of privacy comes transparency, as mentioned AI does not take into account and human interaction. As such the AI will generate what is being asked given the impute and will do so without explaining how, why or where they gathered the information to create such output. The AI is not focused on created sources but instead is focused on creating and delivery, which could be an issue when trying to source and give credit for work that was produced by someone else. Copyright infringement could be what comes to mind initially and with that, legal actions in response to that. "
951,S0311,3,"One major ethical issue associated with generative AI consists of copyright issues. Because generative AI has such an extensive database and utilizes multiple sources sometimes there is no source given when prompted. The information given by the AI could very well be property of another company and their research but the user would never know without a source given. The user inputting prompts to the AI would then have to research to confirm that no other source has already claimed this copyright. Without proper research on the outputs and the theft of companies intellectual property could result in lawsuits. Another relevant issue could consist of the generative text that the AI outputs. A good majority of people are becoming comfortable using AI to create messages or templates in situations where they don’t know how to word something properly. So when they prompt the AI to formulate an email template or something similar and because it lacks a human touch it may have something offensive to others when reading. Lastly, because AI is a human made concept, based on the person who is using the system there may be some biased responses in the answers. When developing the AI, it is suggested that a large team is needed so there are multiple perspectives and ideas that aren't tailored to just one person.

953,S0313,3,"I learned that when it comes to Generative AI there are a lot more legal and ethical issues within an organizational setting that I might have known or realized. Mr. Bader had basically mentioned that Generative AI does raise a lot of concerns due to the misuse of media and a possibility of intellectual property infringement. What I know about that is basking due to the misuse of media like fake news is something that could impact AI as if that type of content is used it would put a major red flag on that content which causes ethical issues. The possibility of intellectual property infringement basically if the AI were to plagiarize another type of property that has rights on it, this would cause a legal issue within the organization. Basically from his response, I learned that AI could need more control in order for it to properly function. If there is a lack of control it might not produce the desired type of product one may be looking for. He also mentioned that Generative AI can also be biased if the data that is inserted in them comes off as bias. This is a big ethical issue because an organization would not want to be known as bias because that would affect one's organization. The AI would have trouble relating to everyone if it's based on a biased data set which could mean a loss of customers which again creates ethical issues within the organization because those same customers may use their freedom of speech to speak bad upon the organization which is bad for business. Again, this is what I felt like I understood from his response and it helped me learn more on ethical and legal issues that never dawned upon me. 

"
954,S0314,3,"A major legal and ethical issue associated with generative AI in organizational settings is copyright. Since AI uses data and sources from all over the internet, it can tend to generate very similar information to what is already out there and it can lead to copyright infringement if not looked over correctly. For example, the user above uses art as an example of how AI can generate a certain art style that is similar to a specific artist. It can copy this artist's style and mimic what they could make. This is a violation of copyright because it takes the artist's work and copies it in a certain way to where there is not a noticeable difference. The reply to this comment makes a good point that AI can be trained to navigate away from copyright issues, but there has to be a specific AI to do that. To add on, a similar ethical issue for organizations using AI would be having the transparency to admit to it. AI can be very straightforward and even though this is beneficial in some cases it can hurt businesses if it is done the wrong way. Consumers like to be heard, and when it comes to AI it can be very general and maybe not meet the customers' needs.

"
955,S0315,3,"Several legal and ethical issues need to be taken into account when using generative AI in organizational contexts. Legally speaking, businesses must make sure that AI usage complies with all applicable laws governing data protection, intellectual property, and data sharing. Concerns including privacy, bias, and openness must be addressed ethically. Data privacy should be given top priority, biased results should be avoided, and generative AI's use and limits should always be disclosed in full transparency by organizations. Organizations can guarantee the ethical and responsible use of generative AI by addressing these issues. Data privacy in regards to generative AI necessitates the gathering of personal information, which may result in privacy concerns if the information is not securely protected. If the data utilized for generative AI is not adequately curated and filtered, it may provide biased results. This might lead to prejudice against particular people or groups. With intellectual property rights, because generative AI can produce novel works of intellectual property, questions about who is entitled to the rights to the new creation may arise. If generative AI is not adequately tested and controlled, it may have unintended repercussions. Organizations must negotiate data protection laws and make sure AI does not compromise sensitive data. In order to uphold justice and trust, they should be open about AI's involvement, prevent reinforcing biases, and create accountability for judgments made using AI."
956,S0316,3,"Some legal and ethical issues are as follows, since AI is so new and a lot of our lawmakers don’t know what it is nor  are they capable of finding out, AI has been used to generate content that is very helpful, but at the same time it can be used to generate some time it can be used to generate some very unhealthy content. For example, there was a song by Drake and The Weekend that got released overnight and no one knew about it, not even the managers. As they investigated they found that the song had been generated purely through AI and was sent out using AI, marketed using AI, and managed using AI. Ethically, we can see how this is very wrong producing a product that someone did not validate or approve while not even needing a person present to create content about them, or for them.”-Cole Kintigh, Instagram follower"
957,S0317,3,"3.	The legal and ethical issues associated with generative AI is can it understand ethics? Ethics are not only just the law and rules; but there are unspoken ethics in life. Generative AI can not understand emotions as well as a real human. For example, dealing with coworkers each of them is different and requires different treatment. The legal issues with generative AI is what happens to the jobs of our people? Will we still have jobs for people and woul this become a legal problem? The world can completely change with the power of AI. Many people in the threads agreed on how AI can understand human feelings which could make it a problem in customer service. I don’t like the idea of generative AI being involved in all work fields. I like the feeling of talking to a real person and that is an important quality us humans need. If we just have AI do everything for us, what will we know? These times are approaching us and many jobs that people have are eventually going to be taken by AI. The best field for you to work in is IT now!"
958,S0318,3,"The legal and ethical issues associated with generative AI in organizational settings are in my opinion associated with the users, not the program itself as stated by the user Ralph Peter. Many users plagiarize the given answers, however it can also be the opposite if the AI is using data collected from other sources without citations or permission. Ethically the data collected must remain confidential or released without the factor of invasion of privacy. However it is entirely difficult to prosecute or sue the developers as it's a fairly new development and there are yet to be any regulations and laws on a judicial level. Moreover ethically there could be some data discrimination, which could lead to biased outcomes if the data has not properly been vetted by a proper source. For instance, the accidental or purposeful discrimination of certain groups or entities could lead to criminal charges.  As for the product made by the AI it could also lead to a battle of intellectual property right since AI can create an entirely new work based on the gathered data. As AI is an entirely new system in the current moment some of the data may unanimously cause unforeseen consequences. Which could negatively affect the organization or individual.   

"
959,S0319,3,"The legal and ethical issues associated with generative AI in organizational settings is the potential for misuse of synthetic media, and even potential infringement of privacy rights. Generative AI is able to create new media that mimics real humans so well, and it can be very hard to differentiate between real and fake. Malicious people can use generated media to slander people in an organization, and the damage to their reputation can be done before it is revealed that the media is not legitimate. The potential for infringement of privacy rights is also a legal and ethical issue because employers collect large amounts of data on their employees, some of it is very personal. If companies were to insert that data into a third party generative AI service for help preparing reports, this can lead to severe privacy violations. When providing data to any third party there is risk of security and control and could lead to sensitive information being leaked. Other issues that were brought to my attention from my Facebook group were intellectual property rights because who is the owner of AI generated content? Also, bias was a concern. If the generative AI is trained on biased data then it is logical that the AI would reinforce the stereotypes or biases of the data. For this question, I utilized the same ChatGPT expert group from the previous two questions as well as a post from a fellow classmate in another Facebook group. I then supplemented this with some research from a website about Data protection issues for employers to consider when using generative AI. "
960,S0320,3,"There are many legal and ethical issues associated with generative AI in organizational settings including data privacy, protection issues, biases in generated content and responsible use of AI content. Currently there are many battles in court being fought over the use of AI to create content. Most notably an AI was able to create a song using the artistic style of Drake and the Weekend. This song has stirred up lots of questions as to the legal right that the technology has to copy and benefit from the artists’ style. Of this  Johnathan Faber,  the founder of Luminary Group and an attorney who specializes in protecting the likeness rights of famous individuals, said in the Billboard business legal news “The ability to create a new work this realistic and specific is disconcerting, and could pose a range of threats and challenges to rights owners, musicians, and the businesses that invest in them,” (Donahue After fake Drake debacle, expect more AI songs. but are they legal? ). 

Other ethical issues of generative AI are the biases that the generated content can produce and the responsible use of AI content. Because the aim of generative A.I is human intelligence the content that is produced or the data that AI can adapt to can be screwed and biased. With that said, the improper use of AI causes vast amounts of societal issues. "
961,S0001,4,"Leveraging generative AI for strategic organizational benefits presents substantial challenges. Firstly, the adequacy and accuracy of data pose a significant hurdle. Generative AI models demand extensive, high-quality datasets for effective training, which can be resource-intensive and time-consuming, especially for specialized or proprietary applications. Secondly, addressing ethical concerns related to bias and fairness is paramount. Generative AI has the potential to perpetuate biases present in the training data, inadvertently leading to discriminatory outcomes. Robust strategies for bias detection and mitigation are essential to ensure equitable AI-generated content and decisions. Thirdly, the opaque nature of certain generative AI models complicates understanding and transparency. Comprehending the mechanisms behind result generation is vital, especially in regulated sectors where explainability is crucial for compliance and trust. In conclusion, when applying generative AI for innovation and strategic advantages, challenges encompass data quality, ethical considerations, model transparency, cybersecurity risks, and organizational adaptation. Effectively tackling these obstacles is pivotal for realizing the complete potential of generative AI in organizational success."
962,S0002,4," Some of the key challenges when applying generative AI to an innovative idea can be the quality and amount of data, training & tuning, and model selection. I could go over all the smaller details but I mainly wanna talk about these 3 that I find to be the most important for applying generative AI. It is the single most important thing for your generative AI to have the a good amount of high quality data if you want your AI to run the absolute best. More data will allow the model to learn a wider range of language patterns, generalization, and how to be more “human” like. Training and Tuning your model can achieve strategic benefits like helping you understand your market better and optimizing that will lead to saving money. Without Training, your AI would only be in stage 1 and wouldn’t be able to work nearly as fast or as reliable. People are very much similar to AI, we are constantly using the data/information in our brain to apply to different situations. If we don’t have the proper training then we couldn’t do our jobs as well as we do them. Having a model selection that is correct for your business model is a key challenge. Model selection is important for effectively producing high-quality data, correlate statistical distributions, satisfy task-specific criteria, taking into account moral and legal considerations, adapting to fields, and staying updated of changes in the field.

963,S0003,4,"The key challenges when applying generative AI to an innovative idea for achieving strategic benefits for an organization would be related to the data quality where generative AI models require vast and high-quality datasets for training where acquiring, cleaning, and maintaining such data can be challenging to apply and also computation power where model size, inference, cost, scalability, training time and energy consumption being computational challenges when planning to implement generative AI and ensure they have the necessary hardware, cloud resources, and budget to support their AI initiatives effectively."
964,S0004,4,"As referenced by the community, one of the largest flaws of generative AI is training its algorithms, it takes specific prompts and information to allow the system to learn your business and get it to the point that it can help you. This disconnection with the organization causes friction with the AI working an innovative idea into the strategic planning. Another apparent problem is the inability to use sensitive information. This point goes back to legal gray areas. Along with it being a morally questionable act, putting personal data about a person or organization into a generative AI can have dangerous legal repercussions. A member in the community answered a question about sensitive information in AI prompts by saying that all information is saved in the program. It is possible that the program is using that information as data to add to its extensive learning program or even in more malice situations, that it is logging that data to eventually sell to others. The member emphasizes that a strict allowance from the owner of the information is required to input it into an AI prompt. This issue causes the businesspeople that use these AI’s to resort to simpler ways of creating the content, which would be by hand or by using various applications to create the desired product. This adds unwanted and possibly unexpected costs and increased timelines.  "
965,S0005,4,"Companies could gain major benefits from including generative AI in their strategic planning. However, incorporating this is definitely not the easiest thing to do. The companies must be able to know when these could be used or not. If human intervention is not present, it could lead to big decision-making mistakes. In that case, instead of helping to reach the company's strategic goals, it would do the opposite. For generative AI to take place in areas that were functioning without it, it would lead to an increase in expenses and consume large amounts of time. Also, these would constantly need to be improved in order to keep working efficiently, which means that it would require a greater amount of effort. Additionally, it's possible for humans to interpret generative AI solutions incorrectly, which could lead to more serious problems if they go unnoticed. Furthermore, another risk from companies using AI too much is the reliance that companies put on it, which could lead to giving less importance to human ideas that could be even better. Although it is true that generative AI based on patterns is able to provide solutions, it is limited to the data that it is trained upon. Meanwhile, humans do possess critical thinking skills and intuition, which is how they are able to tell which solution would do better in different contexts."
966,S0006,4,"There are a number of challenges when applying generative AI to an innovative idea for achieving strategic benefits for an organization. These challenges include data quality and quantity, ethical concerns, and lack of transparency. The most significant challenge seems to be data quality and quantity. High quality data is essential for training, but collecting and curating it can be time-consuming and expensive. This is especially due to the high quantity of data needed to generate useful content. Ethical concerns are a challenge attributable to perpetuate biases from training data. This issue demands rigorous bias detection and mitigation measures. Lastly, the lack of transparency, or “black box” issue. “Black box” refers to generative AI software being comprised of internal workings that are invisible to the user, making the technology difficult to understand. A lack of understanding of how the system works poses a real threat to compliance and trust. In conclusion, there are a lot of kinks that need to be worked out in this relatively new technology. Organizations should address these issues or at least be made aware of them before applying generative AI for strategic organizational advantages, for it could have negative effects on organizations that rely too heavily on it."

Since, as discussed previously, generative AI relies on machine learning and previous user inputs, amount of data, and the accuracy of said data, is vital to creating better plans to be implemented by organizations and businesses. These strategies that are generated by AI will get better and more accurate as users request such information, and will likely change how businesses as well as organizations will conduct their operations. The point of generative AI is to create the most efficient and human-like/centric information on any topic, so innovative strategies created by generative AI will develop in the most efficient way possible. The efficiency that we may request or recognize may not be the most efficient strategy that the AI believes, so it may not be optimized or practical in all senses. Although this is the case as of now, since machine learning is becoming more advanced daily, and since generative AI thrives on user inputs, the more the AI is used, the more accurate organizational strategies, and all topics for that matter, will be. Overall, I would say that this technology will change how we conduct business, and learn as a whole."
968,S0008,4,"- Data quality and availability could be the main obstacles. For generative AI to produce reliable results, a lot of high-quality data is needed. Businesses may find it difficult to get and compile the required data, particularly if they work in highly sensitive or sparsely populated industries.
The intricacy of the algorithms used in generative AI presents another difficulty. For these methods to be implemented and optimized, a substantial amount of computer power and knowledge are frequently needed. To achieve strategic advantages, organizations need to have access to qualified data scientists and engineers who can use generative AI efficiently.
Additionally, it's important to carefully analyze the ethical implications of generative AI. Technology has the capacity to generate damaging or deceptive content and intensify prejudices. Thorough control and respect to rules and laws are necessary to ensure the ethical and responsible usage of generative AI.
Furthermore, stakeholders inside an enterprise may oppose generative AI. Some people could have doubts about technology or worry about losing their jobs in the future. Successful implementation requires addressing these issues and clearly articulating the advantages of generative AI.

Some of the challenges that I found on applying AI to an organization was the issue of data security and storage, in order to apply generative AI to an organizational process, you must feed it some data, and that data must then be processed by models that are likely on the cloud - this creates concerns for data security as some organizations may not allow sensitive data to be used externally. 
The other issue that tends to be an obstacle when implementing AI, is one that we discussed in Question 3 - the legal aspect of AI.

970,S0010,4,"The key challenges for implementing AI in organizational settings include ethical and legal
issues. That may restrain it from reaching its full potential. There are things that it probably
should not produce and other things that it is just restricted from producing due to legal
implications. However, another challenge is that generative AI is still limited in its capabilities.
As mentioned before, I have personally used AI to help make my workflow more efficient, but I
was limited in what I could do. AI is still very early in the development process which causes
many problems. For example, it can produce completely false information and present it as
true. Generative AI is also limited by its algorithms which means that there’s still can be
restrictions built in place which may show bias for one thing over another instead of objective
facts. Although there are some key hurdles generative AI must overcome, the future looks
bright for what it can become and how it could revolutionize the world"
971,S0011,4,"What are the key challenges when applying generative AI to an innovative idea for
achieving strategic benefits for an organization?

 Some key challenges when applying generative artificial intelligence to an innovative
idea for achieving strategic benefits for an organization are the quality of the data,
discrimination, and fairness. It is important that generative artificial intelligence has good
presentable data to be able to function. It also needs to be good for when it is used by
users because the users are hoping to find reliable data to help them with their issues or
problems. Generative artificial intelligence also has another key challenge which is
discrimination. Discrimination plays a big part in the world, especially in workplaces. An
organization&#39;s reputation can be messed up if it is discovered that it discriminated against
a person or user in any way. They have to have the generative artificial intelligence
function properly. The organization must be respectful to everyone as it is mentioned in a
lot of “Terms and Policy” sections of a company, app, or website. Fairness means
considering everyone as equal. If generative artificial intelligence is being used then it is
fair that every worker gets trained or taught on how it is used and how it works. In case
someone calls customer service and has a question regarding the generative artificial
intelligence."
972,S0012,4,"There are many issues when applying generative AI to an innovative idea for achieving strategic
benefits for an organization. Merely to mention some, one major challenge is the availabity and
quality of data. Generative AI depends majorly on a vast of raw data in order to be capable of
delivering accurate results. Unfortunatly with this, some organizations are unable to obtain and
manage high quantative data as it requries Data Scientists to perform that task which it can
create a big cost to the organization. Furthermore, its of high importance to take into account
biases in AI models as it may contain systematic errors in the data which it can potentially lead
to unfairness and discrimanotry outcomes. Organizations must apply strict sytematic errors
detection to avoid any type of unfairness generated by generative AI. Lastly, since AI models are
continuosly learning and gathering new data, it is more transparent. Organizations must be
monitoring and ensuring all information provided is trustworthy and within compliance for
what it was intended for. Although, there could be many benefits when applying generative AI
to an innovative idea for achieving strategic benefits, it is something that is hard to achieve and
it has many negative tradeoffs."
973,S0013,4,"Some key challenges when applying generative AI to an innovative idea for achieving strategic
benefits for an organization would be the availability and quality of data. It is very important that
for generative AI to succeed they have the highest quality of data. This can be a big challenge for
organizations because it needs to have accurate results, money, time, to make sure they achieve
their generated AI. It could possibly affect certain fields that rely heavily on data and ethical
considerations. The problem with using AI in innovation is whether the bot has to correct
information to make new innovations. If this AI picks up any sort of biases while searching for
information, it could cause the information that it provides to become biased and insensitive.
Companies must put guidelines with these bots so they can filter out the negative biases and only
pickup factual information that has no bias. In industries where explain ability is important,
organizations must know how their AI works perfectly and how it generates content so they have
a trace of how the information came to be. If companies don’t know how their bot generates
content, they may come under fire from organizations for false or inaccurate information."
974,S0014,4,"Generative AI content isn’t always reliable. Generative AI can provide outwardly
incorrect results. The business process still needs a human person to verify the

organization for the strategic benefit of business solutions. There are legitimate
reasons to doubt Generative AI, also there is a general skepticism of Generative

management. I believe the concentration of marketing data that would be
automated by Generative AI is a strategic benefit for business processes, but the
concentration of business solutions automated by Generative AI is problematic for
business management applied to marketing research or any kind of analytics. That

975,S0015,4,"The use of AI-enabled reproduction to gain strategic advantage in an organization
presents many formidable challenges. First of all, ensuring access to extensive and
quality training data can be resource-intensive and time-consuming. choosing the most
appropriate generative AI model for a particular task is difficult, as different applications
may require different models. Training and adapting these models properly can be
computationally intensive and require specialized expertise. Ethical standards and
regulatory compliance are paramount, and measures are needed to eliminate bias, ensure
transparency, and comply with the growing regulatory framework for AI models AI are
often uninterpretable, posing challenges in understanding and trusting AI-generated
results. Navigating regulatory compliance is another hurdle, as organizations need to stay
current with the changing regulations surrounding AI. Integrating AI into existing
business processes and systems can require significant change and investment.
Establishing effective collaboration between human operators and AI systems, especially
in creative or decision-making activities, is a difficult challenge. In addition, security and
privacy concerns, cost considerations, and the cultural shift required for AI adoption all
present formidable barriers. Balancing these challenges is important for organizations
that want to make the most of the benefits of generative AI. Addressing these issues
requires a holistic approach, requiring multidisciplinary expertise, careful planning and a
clear organizational structure."
976,S0016,4,"WebClues Infotech also included in one of their posts some of the ethical considerations
when it comes to training generative AI. Because generative AI is completely dependent
on the quality of the data it is trained on, there will be cases in which it has been trained
on data that it was not permitted to be trained with. This leads to the issue of intellectual
property, as well as raising the question of who actually owns the generated content.
Furthermore, there are now new and emerging threats in the information security space,
as generative AI is actively used to deceive employees by faking voices, and even deep
fake images used to socially engineer employees."
977,S0017,4,"The key challenges when applying generative AI to innovative ideas for
strategic benefits for organizations are looking into the data, but not always following blindly.

While the AI is made to try and understand processing as humans do, it does not fully understand
everything humans do, enjoy, or want and need to be done. The AI might not know exactly what
you are looking for when it comes to your exact situation. The AI is not always right, as said
above it can be given falsified or biased info pertaining to something and then recommend the
wrong way for things to be done. The challenge is to use it as a lighter blueprint but still keep the
human aspect on top of that to make sure everything is optimized for all the strategic benefits.
Another challenge is how much an employer trusts the AI over his employees and how
integrated into the company some one would want the AI. Also, the AI needs to be checked to
make sure that everything is done ethically, morally, and legally correct. It can be difficult to add
the technology into an established workplace, either for the employees or just for the company
itself."
978,S0018,4,"A key challenge of applying generative AI in innovative ideas is that the AI
output is only as good as the AI input; therefore, skilled AI prompting is required. “Trash
in; trash out” would be the perfect quote for this, as generative AI can only analyze data
that it is trained with (data input). In order for the organization to succeed in AI
prompting, they must clearly know the 5 W’s (who, what, when, where, why) and how of
their wants and needs. Failure to do so can lead to unwanted or obscure results, which
will not be any help at all for the organization. Thus, a well-defined and data-informed
strategy for AI input and instruction is pivotal for unlocking the full potential of
generative AI in achieving strategic goals and innovation.
Another challenge in this context revolves around the ability to measure the
impact and return on investment (ROI) of applying generative AI to an innovative idea
for organization strategy. Quantifying the benefits and assessing whether the use of

can accurately gauge the effectiveness of AI-generated content or strategies. Without a
way to measure the impact, it becomes challenging to justify the resources and
investment in the generative AI technology used for the innovation project."
979,S0019,4,"According to Reddit users, there are many obstacles to overcome when applying generative AI to
an innovative idea for achieving strategic benefits for an organization. One significant challenge
to overcome is the need for high quality data sets. The reason being is that much time and money
is required, especially if it is for specialized applications of the AI. Additionally, generative AI
needs good data to work well, and if that data is wrong, biased, or even fake, it can lead to
inaccurate output. It can be a challenge to get past this since generative AI is based on previous
data and recognizing its patterns, and thus all of it can be warped. Next, the generative AI can be
too generalized and organizations may struggle with finding exactly what it is they are looking
for. It is also significant to note that companies should not heavily rely on AI, because AI may
not always be the answer. Interpersonal relationships and connections are crucial as well and that
cannot be accomplished through this technology. Lastly, there may be ethical dilemmas to
overcome with generative AI. Again, it can learn from biased data and because of this, it can
sometimes make unfair choices. Organizations need to use strong tools to find and fix these
biases to make sure that there are no issues. Overall, generative AI has its challenges as most
things do, but through research and practice, these challenges can be overcome."
980,S0020,4,"Leveraging generative AI for strategic benefits within organizational contexts
presents a multitude of opportunities, but it's not without its challenges. The
ethical and legal dimensions of generative AI deployment require meticulous
attention. Ensuring alignment with ethical guidelines and legal frameworks,
including matters related to data privacy, informed consent, and the potential for
biases, is imperative. Addressing biases inherited from training data is a vital
part, needing the implementation of bias mitigation techniques. Balancing the
role of human intervention and AI automation is a continual challenge, as
organizations must discern when human ability is indispensable and when AI can run independently. The growing sophistication of AI systems amplifies their
attractiveness as targets for cyberattacks, underscoring the necessity for robust
cybersecurity measures. Financial considerations cannot be overlooked, as the
development and maintenance of generative AI systems often involves
substantial resource allocation and cost management. The introduction of
generative AI may need organizational and cultural adjustments, with employees
often requiring training and support to acclimate to AI-driven processes. Tackling
these challenges mandates a comprehensive and strategic approach,
incorporating feasibility studies, stakeholder engagement, and ongoing
monitoring and adaptation to ensure congruence with overarching strategic

core principles of design thinking are empathy, collaboration,
experimentation, and a willingness to embrace failure as a source of
learning. Understanding user expectations regarding data protection can
help identify potential risks related to data collection and generate ideas
for solutions that are innovative. When I worked on a campaign for Meta,
they also incorporated Design Thinking before starting and releasing a
new product or service. From the beginning of creating a prototype if the

could arise when using it to achieve a strategic benefit. For one, AI has yet to be perfected.
Talking from experience, AI struggles a lot to create a simple financial statement such as the
balance sheet. It may do the math wrong, which ultimately causes confusion among the user. In
the words of Reddit user Quantius, ""The big obstacle for generative AI is that is lacks
specificity/context and it has no ability to understand perception and politics."" Generative AIs
have not evolved to the point where they can understand emotion the way we humans do. This
can lead to rather monotonous answers that lack a real drive of passion. Say for example you
are a commercial banker who has to prepare a presentation in front of a loan committee. You
must do it in a way that’s both innovative while retaining key elements that your clients hope to
convey. Sure you could ask a generative AI program such as ChatGPT to create a project for
you. However, there is still that lack of specificity needed among the numbers and
fundamentals. If people and companies alike could just trust AI’s the way they do people, there
would be a lack of job market in many sectors. Obviously this is not the case, as a person holds
a lot more credibility (at least at this point in time)."

Generative AI models, especially deep learning models, often require a large amount of high-quality data to generate meaningful and innovative outcomes. Acquiring, cleaning, and preparing this data can be a significant challenge.

Data Privacy and Security:Organizations need to ensure that the data used to train and fine-tune generative AI models adhere to privacy and security regulations. Managing sensitive data and complying with legal requirements can be a complex task.

Algorithm Selection and Optimization:
Choosing the appropriate generative AI algorithm and optimizing it for a specific innovation idea is non-trivial. Different algorithms have different strengths and weaknesses, and tuning them to suit the specific goals of the organization can be a challenge.

Understanding Business Needs and Goals:
Aligning the generative AI approach with the organization's strategic objectives and ensuring it addresses a genuine business need is crucial. Understanding the business context and defining clear objectives is essential to generate innovation that aligns with organizational goals.

Interpretability and Explainability:
Generative AI models often operate as ""black boxes,"" making it challenging to understand their inner workings and interpret the generated outputs. Ensuring that the AI-generated ideas are interpretable and explainable to stakeholders is important for gaining trust and making informed decisions.

990,S0030,4,"According to Shailesh Kumar, there appears to be ten main challenges. These challenges are data
quality & quantity, model selection, training & tuning, ethical consideration, intellectual
property, interpretability, integration & deployment, continuous learning & adaptation, cost, and
user acceptance. For the first challenge, these generative AI models need large and meaningful
datasets to create useful results. This problem relies on gathering and curating the data that is
being fed into the AI model. For the second challenge, there are many models out there, and an
organization needs to be able to choose the one that relates to the organization’s objective the
most. Choosing the wrong model can lead the company astray from its original mission. For the
third challenge, training AI models can cost lots of money and time. There needs to be a deep
level of understanding in the model in order to use it effectively. For the fourth challenge, there

are ethical concerns such as bias, misinformation, and privacy. These faults can create data that is
not usable. For the fifth challenge, there are legal challenges that must be addressed when using
data from AI models as they can be too closely related to existing data that people have
ownership of. For the sixth challenge, the user must understand what the data means from the AI
generated content. If the user can’t use it, it is useless. For the seventh challenge, the data must
be able to be used for the organization. For the eighth challenge, models require updates, so it

organization has to put into, in order for the usage of generative AI to be actually
beneficial. See organization would have to make their own generative AI, as mentioned
before some public generative AI, might put them at risk if they decide to use it in the
workplace. So imagine the amount of resources they have to put in order to create their
own. Even then the way they make it has to be beneficial and used by them only unless
they want to expand the idea to other businesses who might use their verison. Even then
resources are going to be used just to maintain it, again the usage of doing anything
online could be a risk. Then again if it was done the business needs to make sure that the
data they use is very beneficial for them. Meaning their data needs to be structured
correctly, make sure their AI is being used correctly, meaning there might need to be
extra training, and overall be well organized. As well as the amount of time needed,
overall there are a few challenges that an organization has to deal with, but once done it

993,S0033,4,"Generative AI being so new presents many complications for business owners to
implement into there business. One major complication for business owners is to be able to have
generative AI be personilized with the companies needs. Due to Artificial Intelligence programs
having so much data, companies have to create a subset of the data so that the new AI feature
will complement there already existing product. This process can be very complex and if not
done properly AI will not fully give the benefits to the company. The second large challenge that
companies face is making sure the implementation of AI meets all legal and ethical
requirements. Due to some AI programs having biased data, if a company decides to use this
program it will also result in biased information. The way companies can prevent this is to create
controls within the company that detect whether or not biased or untruthful information is being
portrayed by the AI. Finally, the last reason AI presents issues for companies is the quality of

data. If the quality of data presented from the generative AI does not align or meet the companies
standards, the AI will not be able to help the company further progress in the business world."

but these are some few that stood out to me.Making sure that the AI is producing high quality
data and in good quantities is key since if the AI produces the lowest quality of data, it’s useless.
Also if it’s not able to produce massive amounts of choices for users then it becomes unreliable.
As for the training and fine tuning of AI, it’s important that it’s able to do its job effectively,
since it’s most likely being tasked to do one job. With AI that’s already out there, like ChatGPT,
Pixlr, and DJ from Spotify, they all have been tailored to do one job. ChatGPT can help answer
questions, Pixlr creates images based on prompts, and DJ helps suggest new music that users
may be interested in listening to based on their music history and liked songs. Also a good train
can reduce the amount of time it takes for that AI to run that task. Finally with ethical
consideration, it’s important to see that the AI doesn’t begin to racial profile certain ethnic
groups or else more Google search incidents will begin to appear, or even potential harsh events
like preventing those ethnic groups from opportunities that are usually presented to others. It’s
crucial that it remains unbiased despite what their pattern recognition says.

alter or change the results of something by creating bots to flood the internet with false
information. AI tries to recognize a pattern on the internet and if someone comes along and
throws a bunch of false information in the way of that AI, it can end up producing something the

problems for users if their privacy is not respected and protected as required by law.
Another challenge posed by using generative ai is that it can produce false or misleading
information; generative ai strives to be accurate and relevant but it still has the potential for being
incorrect and spreading misinformation depending on the the data it was trained on.
Another issue is regarding accountability for mistakes or problems caused by utilizing

1002,S0042,4,"When applying generative AI to an organizational setting, there are some key challenges
on using the AI to achieve strategic benefits for the organization. While researching, there were a
lot of key challenges that came up with the questions given. However, I will narrow it down to 4
main points with the first being of data quantity and quality, as AI can be of use the nature of it,
you would need to give it large amounts of data and the key challenge of that is gathering and
curating the data for the AI depending on the content you want the AI to be used for. Secondly,
the ethical application of AI as often it would be in the territory of biases based from the
developers from training, specifically the selective data given, the privacy and security factor as
well with the datasets, and the legal applications of intellectual property as that of itself is a
whole other issue.
Thirdly, another key challenge is the cost of AI. The world right now is in a time of
technological advancement as everything now is digitized. However, with the advancement of
technology comes the higher rise of cost as new things are being developed, new jobs and new
innovations are being tracked behind it and that comes with the cost of money and resources.
Using AI is by no means cheap as well, because of technological advancements, everything is
available on the internet but at the same while there is a lot of information, there can be a lot of
cost that comes with it because you would have to constantly update the AI with new datasets
and maintenance on it as well is not cheap. Lastly, is the public or user acceptance of AI, as
many organizations or companies may use AI to streamline their production processes or
services for their customers, it also depends on the customers or user’s acceptance of the use of it
because it can go one side or the other. Either it can go really well with like how students using
the chatbot for services like Amazon, libraries, etc to streamline their need of getting products or
services or it can go the other way and be notorious as it is right now with AI art as the majority

biased.
There are many key challenges when applying generative AI to an innovative idea for
achieving strategic benefits for an organization. Generative AI systems can inadvertently
perpetuate biases present in their training data. Addressing this challenge involves
implementing mechanisms to detect and rectify bias, ensuring fair and unbiased
decision-making in HR and other processes.
As highlighted in the original article and comments, there is resistance to AI's
involvement in hiring. Achieving user acceptance and trust in AI systems is crucial,
necessitating effective communication and transparency about how AI aids
decision-making. AI systems often rely on sensitive data for HR and hiring purposes.
Protecting data privacy and complying with data regulations while using AI is a
significant challenge.

Ensuring that AI systems are both accurate and fair in their assessments is a complex
task. Striking the right balance between speed and precision is essential to achieve
effective decision-making. Integrating generative AI into an organization's processes
should align with its strategic objectives. The challenge is to ensure that AI supports and
enhances these goals, rather than introducing complications.
Ethical concerns, such as the impact of AI on job displacement and its influence on
workers, must be addressed. Organizations need to establish ethical guidelines for AI use.
Furthermore, navigating the evolving regulatory landscape concerning AI is challenging.
Organizations must stay informed and adapt their practices to comply with relevant laws
and regulations
Incorporating generative AI into organizational processes while addressing these
challenges can lead to innovative and strategic benefits. It requires a balanced approach
that considers both the potential advantages of AI and the ethical and practical concerns

and well-developed, there is no guarantee of information integrity. This may present liability for
companies attempting to utilize AI for innovation. Next, the data generated by the software

reflects input data. Any mistakes will lead to inaccuracies or harmful biases. Lastly, ethics
problems as defined by the previous question are certainly an issue. The creative nature of
generative AI presents risk and opportunity for misuse, two things that organizations certainly
wish to avoid."
1005,S0045,4,"According to Karan Sachdeva, organizations&#39; three most significant challenges with generative
AI are data privacy, security, model interpretability, and integration with existing workflows.
Generative AI models require large datasets to learn and generate outputs but also handle
sensitive information, which can cause risks. So, it is essential to ensure compliance with
protecting data regulations, and safeguarding sensitive data from potential breaches is crucial.
Organizations need an excellent quality of security to prevent any unauthorized users from
accessing the generated AI system. Since generative AI learns from data it is exposed to, and

training data contains biases, it can perpetuate the generated outputs. A lack of model
interpretability can be a significant roadblock to AI adaptation in industries where transparency
and accountability are critical. If AI models cannot explain the decision-making process clearly,
customers and regulators may question its accuracy. Integrating with existing workflow can be
challenging, too, because adapting and ensuring that AI-generated outputs align with existing
standards and requirements can require modifications and effort. Training generative AI might
require computational resources, time, and expertise. Smaller businesses or organizations with
limited access to high-quality computing might have issues with training and using AI models.
Organizations should be able to successfully go through these challenges and find solutions for
them."
1006,S0046,4,"As mentioned before, there are legal and ethical factors associated with generative AI that
would come accross as a challenege to an organization but other obstacles can includes things
like adaptability. Adapting to this new innovation can require some time and reliability. AI
development expertise may be necessary for the implementation of generative AI technologies.
Many firms might not have the internal skills required to develop and manage generative AI
systems efficiently. The adoption of generative AI technology may encounter resistance or
reluctance, depending on the organizational culture and workforce. A successful adoption
requires effective training, communication, and change management techniques. Another
obstacle is making sure everything is accurate. Acquiring high-quality, relevant data for training
generative AI models can be a significant hurdle. In some cases, obtaining the necessary data
may be expensive or esentially challenging. Which also leads to another potential challenge,
cost. The technologies needed for AI can be a substantial upfront investment and further
expenses of installation, software updates, and securty system may be required. These
expenses are definitely something organization would need to consider before moving forward
with the process. Although applying generative AI to innovative ideas within an organization can
be beneficial, challenges such as adaptability, accuratness, and cost may be some things
organizational leaders need to examine."
1007,S0047,4,"Applying generative AI to innovative ideas for achieving strategic benefits in an organization is
accompanied by several key challenges. Firstly, the complexity of implementing generative AI
systems necessitates a significant investment in specialized talent and resources. Finding skilled
professionals capable of developing, maintaining, and optimizing generative AI models poses a
considerable challenge, particularly in a competitive talent market.
Secondly, ensuring the ethical and responsible use of generative AI is critical, as the technology's
potential for misuse, such as generating deceptive content or deepfakes, can lead to reputational
damage and legal repercussions. Establishing comprehensive governance frameworks and ethical
guidelines is essential to mitigate these risks and ensure the responsible deployment of
generative AI solutions.
Thirdly, the interpretability and explainability of generative AI outputs remain a persistent
challenge. Understanding the decision-making processes of complex generative models is often
intricate, making it difficult for organizations to trust and fully rely on AI-generated outcomes for
critical business decisions. Enhancing the interpretability of generative AI systems through
advanced techniques and transparent algorithms is crucial for fostering trust and confidence in
their outputs.

Moreover, the scalability and adaptability of generative AI models to varying organizational
needs and contexts present another challenge. Tailoring generative AI solutions to specific
industry requirements and ensuring their seamless integration with existing organizational
infrastructure demands a comprehensive understanding of both AI capabilities and organizational
workflows.
Lastly, the continuous evolution of generative AI technologies necessitates organizations to stay
updated with the latest advancements and trends. Keeping pace with the rapidly evolving
landscape of generative AI requires a commitment to ongoing research and development, as well
as a willingness to adapt organizational strategies to leverage the full potential of these
technological advancements.
In overcoming these challenges, organizations can harness the transformative power of
generative AI to drive innovation, enhance operational efficiency, and achieve sustainable
strategic benefits."
1008,S0048,4,"Summary:
I think the best AI depends on your specific goals in this case, if you're looking for creative writing I think
Bard or Chat GPT is good. If you need general info and to expanded convos, GPT-4 or Bing Chat are also
great options. For in depth conversations Claude works well and for math or stats questions Perplexity is a
good option. There are tons of different options and you should make sure to focus your choice with the
requirements you need. I think exploring and experimenting with different options can also help in
determining which one is “best” one. Most people have mentioned that they prefer one AI over the other
based on their own separate experiences and what they use it for, I have noticed that GPT and and GPT4
being the most popular though due to its coding."
1009,S0049,4,"Users from the Quora community insist that applying generative AI to drive strategic
advantages in organizations presents a trio of formidable challenges. First, the voracious appetite
for data is a prominent hurdle. Generative AI models hunger for copious amounts of high-quality
data, a resource not always readily available or well-suited to these models. Second, the
development and deployment of generative AI models is intricate and resource-intensive,

10
demanding expertise in machine learning, data science, and software engineering. This
complexity can strain an organization&#39;s resources and project timelines.
Third, generative AI models often operate as black boxes, making it arduous to grasp their
decision-making processes and explain their outputs. In fields where trust and accountability are
paramount, this interpretability gap can thwart widespread adoption. To surmount these
challenges, organizations need to prioritize data strategies, such as data collection and
refinement, potentially through partnerships, and assemble cross-disciplinary teams adept in the
various aspects of model development. Furthermore, investing in research to enhance model
interpretability and transparency is vital. By navigating these challenges judiciously,
organizations can harness the strategic potential of generative AI effectively."
1010,S0050,4,"4) Something I didn’t think about when applying
generative AI is that you need to feed it data. It is
good to feed AI large quantities of data that is
diverse. One of the challenges would be for

organizations who are starting something new. For new and
upcoming industries there may not be much data and certainly
not any historical data. This means that they will have to be more
creative in how they use AI. Maybe instead they can use AI for
creating new business models that best fit a certain market
target. Another challenge is producing ethical results using AI.
This has more to do with the quality of your data. If you don’t
take the proper precautions and vet, the data you plan to give to
the AI program. This could take time and money that many companies would not want to invest
in. This will lead to unintentionally discriminatory results as stated above. AI is very difficult to
understand. To regulate the use of AI, you must first understand it. AI by its very nature is hard
to make transparent because it eventually creates its own content. Not only that but it takes
loads of data to get the AI to produce quality results. It will be hard to tell which data the AI
pulled from to create the content that the organization is using.

I decided to answer a question about blockchains. Blockchain was a topic that we discussed in
the beginning of the semester that interested me. The concept of potentially doing away with
contractual lawyers and paper contracts, in general, was really thrilling. Based on the article “Global
Supply Chains Are About to Get Better, Thanks to Blockchain” by Casey and Wong, blockchain is suited
to provide more transparency in supplier/buyer dealings. I used what I learned in the article to provide
an example of how blockchains could be used in organizations and why it was becoming such a big deal.
I also informed the poster about the contractual benefits of blockchain, which have been useful to many
who use it today. Blockchain will be able to be used for contractual agreements because it gives each
user a special number that is unique just like a fingerprint."

implementation and understanding of generative AI processes within organizations."
1012,S0052,4,"The first major challenge that I think about when considering key challenges for applying
generative AI is automation possibly depleting the need for human creativity. To elaborate, AI
has made major improvements and is able to learn patterns extremely well. It can copy artists’
distinct style or sound so well. There have been a few examples of AI produced covers that
sound hauntingly like something that Drake or Taylor Swift would write. For AI, there was this
preemptive notion that it would be utilized so that people would be able to cut down on
mundane, repetitive tasks and saving time so that people could focus more on the creative side of
aspects.

To continue, many employees are experiencing so much fear when it comes to job
security. As more roles do become automated, people are worried their roles will be no longer
relevant and fear will act as the major motivation of people’s work. If someone’s safety is
threatened, such as their income so they can afford to live, people will not be productive and not
be able to perform at their best ability at work. Businesses still need to remember that people
experience Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs. How will the economy and society be fundamentally
changed in the long run? Since there is never an answer until we experience it ourselves, there is
such a high level of uncertainty being experienced by so many people.
Third, since AI is something that is becoming prevalent right now, laws are still being
developed and implemented. Companies will have to constantly be checking in on what is and
what is not acceptable. Therefore, businesses plans might have to change drastically and there
will always be constant learning and be a major disruption in the business process."

1014,S0054,4,"There are many challenges when applying

generative AI to an innovative idea for achieving strategic benefits for an organization. One of
these challenges is data availability, in order for generative AI to be effective it must have
training from large high quality data sets. Not a lot of organizations have access to these sets of
data so, ensuring access to the correct type of data and making sure the quality of the data is
good can be a big challenge. Another challenge organizations may face is the cost and the
amount of resources it takes to implement generative AI. It not only takes an immense amount
of expertise in the subject, but it also requires a lot of financial resources which some
organizations might find challenging. Scalability can also be a challenge for new organizations
who decide to apply generative AI to their business. Ensuring that the generative AI can meet
demands as the organization grows is very important because you do not want to put all of this
time and money into creating an AI just for it to not be useful as your organization gets bigger
and bigger. Even though there are challenges presented when applying generative AI to an
organization it can still be done if the proper steps are followed."
1015,S0055,4,NaN
1016,S0056,4,"- Throughout this whole assignment, I’ve come to understand that generative AI relies on model
training to process and generate information. Being reliant on a particular model training data set
can impose limitations on its capabilities, requiring increased investment and possibly a
dedicated department within the company. A great example I found on the stock exchange is a
forum based around ChatGPT and how it cannot answer questions about information it wasn’t
trained upon.

Due to its limitations, it is very unlikely that generative AI can do quality work if it doesn&#39;t have
the proper training manuals to cover specific information. While there is a concept called
“document retrieval” that theoretically offers a solution by adding information to Open AI’s
embedding tool, it remains challenging and faces various hurdles. Additionally, this model can
struggle with tasks that require a wider background knowledge of that particular data set, so it
would not work on the current model of ChatGPT. The drawback of depending on particular data
sets highlights the importance of careful thinking and adjustment when incorporating generative
AI technology."
1017,S0057,4,"One key challenge would be the over-reliance on the AI to solve problems for a company. This can lead to a brain drain of intelligent workers who are not used for complex tasks, and creating a culture that becomes limited by the problems that an AI can solve.
AI cannot legally gain a copywrite, so things generated from and AI may not be something that can be owed by the company that created it. This can be at odds with a company’s goals
The data that the AI uses may be lacking in quality for a specific type of information that may be important to a company. Poor data quality can also generate a bias from the AI, which could be based on human nature or just incomplete data 
You also have to take your current workflows and software into account when looking at AI, as AI may not be able to work with or interpret your data in a meaningful way.
The point of any company is to make money, so if the return on investment does not make sense for your business, then this would not help you  in the long term.
AI is also constantly improving and learning, so you need to be able to adapt to these new changes as they come.
"
1018,S0058,4,"The main challenge would be taking inspiration from AI generated components and turning
them into something original that is actually usable and beneficial for the organization. When the output
of artificial intelligence is dependent on seemingly infinite input curated to fit a single user’s request,
there is a lot of room for fluff and unusable results. Knowing how to get something out of these tools is a
skill on its own. The originality aspect matters because a proprietary system/process/product is usually
valued by organizations. Using others’ work with no alterations may not grant that advantage. On that
note, legal issues are another obstacle an organization could face when using generative AI as a tool. As
mentioned earlier, there seems to be a lot of grey areas as to what counts as original or not,
copyrightable or not, etc. when it comes to creation and the use of AI in that process. It won’t get easier
any time soon, as well, since as generative-AI grows and evolves, the regulation of it will have to do the
same. One last challenge comes with assuring paranoid consumers that what you are doing is ethical

(which comes with the additional challenge of ensuring that it is). AI is a rapidly growing technology that
most don’t completely understand. Being transparent about the organization’s practices might not be
enough to persuade skeptics."
1019,S0059,4,"I believe the key challenges include all the legal and ethical issues discussed in question 3. For
example, I discussed how easily poor-quality information could be generated from generative AI
models that are not trained properly. To overcome this the model needs to have realistic and
diverse data to learn from. However, this can be costly to obtain the training data and very time-
consuming because of the training and continual monitoring to check for errors. Another
challenge is security. Anything online has the potential to be hacked or experience some type of
‘bug’. If an organization trained a generative AI model using old data from the company’s past
and it experiences a security attack, this information could be made public or even used against
it for ransom. The internal and external controls of a company that uses AI would need to be
top-tier in order to prevent his challenge from happening. Another challenge that I see if
people’s fear of change. In order for an innovative idea to really benefit an organization the
employees are going to have to learn about it as well and support the idea. Many people view

generative AI as scary or simply as a way of taking humans&#39; jobs, meaning they would not be
willing to learn how it use it if a company wanted to implement it into their work systems."
1020,S0060,4,"The key challenges when applying Generative AI to an innovative idea for achieving strategic
benefits for an organization may include getting the exact output you want/having company-
specific results and the risk of information leakage and privacy breaches.
It is difficult to get company-based outputs because the Generative AI may not have all of the
necessary information. Therefore, specific strategic benefits would be difficult to obtain and the
AI’s output may not be helpful for the company in the long run. Additionally, there becomes a
concern for privacy breaches and a risk of information leakage. For example, hackers and
malicious users can manipulate AI models to learn about a company or individual’s private
information. Another way that data leakage could occur is through the model itself since AI
utilizes information that it already has.
The challenges with applying Generative AI to an innovative idea for achieving strategic benefits
also correlate with the legal and ethical issues it may cause. One concept is the possibility of a

Edra 7
biased output based on the model and data that the AI pulls from. Having a biased output by the
AI, and not realizing it on the business side may be detrimental to the company’s image.
It is important that companies who utilize Generative AI are careful with how they utilize it, make
sure there are humans to check the process (especially the output), and is the result ethical,
legal, and unbiased."
1021,S0061,4,"Thinking about the challenges of AI, it will again boil down to the ethical issues plus the security
and privacy of the company. Based on the post answered by one of the Redditors, one of the
key challenges is making sure that the integration of AI into the human workflow will be
successful by “ensuring user adaptation”. Like he said, there will be a lot of changes needed to
be done for it to be successful and to be able to make the job or work more efficient and easier.
Traditional processes and training would need to be changed to be able to accommodate the
growing technology of AI. Continuous study about AI is being done by different tech companies
and there will be more improvements in the future. As it grows daily, we would need to
implement training AI models and for it to not be limited to tech companies but to also train
companies from other fields which is particularly to develop business ideas that are widely
understood and researched.
Programmers and scientists might need to conduct lectures and training for businesses or any
outside help that would teach business individuals how AI would help their businesses in

1024,S0064,4,"What are the key challenges when applying generative AI to an innovative idea for
achieving strategic benefits for an organization?
Perhaps the main challenge when it comes to applying generative AI to innovative ideas
is the fact that AI is unable to understand context and human nuances. Innovation requires
creativity which often requires human emotion and complex thinking outside of the box. AI can
only analyze and interpret data; it lacks the ability to understand the meaning behind the data it is
analyzing in the way that a human can. It can also only do what it is programmed to do and does
not have the capability to think on its own (yet). Furthermore, generative AI can only create
content after it has been exposed to data that it can analyze and use. It is unable to create content
on its own without the help of humans that feed it ideas and provide them with the parameters
they need to create content. This means that AI cannot come up with innovative ideas on its own
in the way that humans have for thousands of years. Another issue a user in
r/ArtificialInteligence brought up is the issue of morality. Generative AI is unable to understand
the concept of morality---since it can’t understand human nuances---so it will not register that is
being immoral or that it should change anything."
1025,S0065,4,"Applying data received from AI can be tremendously helpful in helping innovative ideas come to
life and in aiding organizations. However, as is with any sort of technology, there are key
challenges that come with this. One issue that comes alongside the increasing use of the
implementation of AI in the workplace is that artificial intelligence cannot fully capture the
sentience of humanity. Humans are able to make discernments and make decisions based on
discretion, something AI cannot fully do. Strategy becomes black and white, with no room for
error. Like the comment above suggests, this is something that is already being seen in certain
industries. While generative AI may aid in approving a loan for a customer, it leaves no
discretion for bankers. Therefore, ensuring that human interaction is still a role in business

organizations is a key challenge as it also provides customers to feel like they are being heard
and to address any shortcomings of generative AI. Other key challenges include making sure that
the information you are receiving or utilizing from generative AI is specific to your organization
and is relevant. Over generalized data can hinder optimal results and performance and in some
cases even create harm if not correctly applied."

1027,S0067,4,"Some key challenges when applying generative AI to an innovative idea would be data
quality/availability, bias/fairness, change management, security risk etc. These challenges require
planning and approaches from many people from different multidisciplinary approaches. It’s important
to strike a balance between automation and human involvement for successful implementation."
1028,S0068,4,"The key challenges I see when companies apply generative AI to innovative ideas for
their strategic benefit could be people becoming too dependent on the technology and
losing their human touch and message within the products of it. It is a great and powerful
tool that is only becoming more popular day by day. I do not see a world where not one
company doesn’t use it to some capacity in their operations. However, it is just a tool
and to effectively use it companies must realize they cannot become dependent on it for
unpopular tasks or creative endeavors that they don’t want to invest in. As everything is
becoming more and more digitized the general consumer will see through it all for the
human element and touch within the company, or seek one with more if there is a major
lack of it. I think even more so for an innovative idea, because innovation is supposed to
come from such a desire to boost universal human experience and make them better. I
fear companies will overlook the capacity of human skills for cheaper and faster
technological fixes. Within technology as well it is becoming easier and faster for
systems to be aged especially with generative AI as it is ever changing minute by
minute. This will cause companies to be forever chasing newer and better technologies if
that is what they depend on for their operational needs."
1029,S0069,4,"Question #4: There are many challenges that can occur when operating a business or
organization when applying generative AI to inventive ideas to achieve great success. Overall,
the foundation of AI lies in the hands of humans. It is up to us to create and control it how we
want or need it. That is where it can get tricky. Not everyone who uses AI utilizes it with the
most pure intentions but rather uses it to bring businesses/organizations down. I think common
knowledge when applying AI to a new business idea is to start by asking yourself what you need
AI to do to unveil this idea. A generative model will operate on what you feed it. So a business
needs to ask itself what is that it wants to accomplish and how can AI help in doing so. Many
challenges such as wrongdoings can occur if not done correctly. Challenges such as feeding the
model the wrong information can have your idea going down the wrong path. Not knowing how
to operate the AI model with appropriate information and tasks can make it more difficult in the

long run than not using AI at all. Overall, artificial intelligence models need to be managed
properly and intelligently."
1030,S0070,4,"Some of the challenges organizations might face are funds and workforce. If they were to implement a new operating system such as generative AI that would come with costs associated with installation, maintenance, and oversight to name a few. The average costs that come with this range from 10,000 to 30,000. These staggering numbers make it hard for newer players to enter the game. This means that more money will be spent and more people will have to be hired. As there are employees coming in to operate the new system, that might mean there are employees being laid off because of that same system. This causes issues of bad morale, shrinkage, and at times pay cuts that widen the pay gap. All of these issues can affect the workplace environment as each person who didn’t get replaced is now walking on eggshells hoping their position isn’t next. As finding a way to cut costs is always on the minds of managers, those who are working in an automated field or position are at the highest risk of replacement. These drastic people-moving changes in the workforce could lead to the economy being affected. If people aren’t making money, they can’t spend any.

1031,S0071,4,"Some of the key challenges for applying generative AI to an innovative idea for achieving
strategic benefits for an organization will be both regulations and how far they can push creation

like music many artists sample their music from that of the past to make something new. But
how far can you really sample before you start getting in trouble with the law and the copyright
owners? AI’s like Chat GPT or Playground needed to be tested to be able to work by using
already published media to analyze data and produce the information when requested it is likely
to repackage what it used to learn from and end up making something that is “new” but in all
actuality, it is not. Now some nations have actually begun to crack down on Chat GPT due to
concerns that this AI can be used for malicious intent and is too easily accessible but the United

1032,S0072,4,"a) A big issue with its application is the question of ownership. If it was generated
by AI who really owns the intellectual property? Does it go to the company that
generated it? What if the generated product is identical to another company
applying the same generated information as the other? These questions are
difficult to answer since application of generative AI is still in its infant stages.
The technology is still new and is barely entering the market for these types of
uses. There are also specific regulations that come with using AI within an
organization depending on which industry its being used in. Data protection laws
also do come in affect when regarding to AI usage within ones organization."
1033,S0073,4,"One of the key challenges in applying generative AI is the reality that results are only as good as the
data it is given. Often, it can be difficult to measure the quality and usefulness of the data given to the
models. Especially because there are a lot of variables that affect the end result, it is easy to leave out
some that could change the outcome. Not to mention, good-quality data is hard to come by.
Additionally, depending on how complicated the variables are, it is hard to make generative AI
understand the small details humans are aware of. Generative AI can help with filtering the
information, but users need to be cautious about some blind spots it has.
     Another challenge in applying generative AI is the cost. In order to get the best results, there is a
need to hire AI mathematicians and other experts. Often times, it requires an experienced team to
interact with the process of generative AI. Not only that, it is costly to set up equipment and work on
proper algorithms. After setting up the team and equipment, AI has to be evaluated and tested.
Although it is not always required to go this far, if organizations want specific results that are
personalized and work efficiently with their innovative ideas, it is recommended.
Likewise, the cost of training AI models has been increasing because the size of the models
continues to grow. What makes it challenging is how bigger models require more computational
resources and computational power. These costs can often be in the millions. Although there has been
some progress in reducing costs, it often becomes pointless when the size grows faster than the
improvements."
1034,S0074,4,"There has been much talk about how Generative AI can improve business efficiency in
leaps and bounds. However, as admitted by some, it still cannot be leveraged by organizations in
fruitful ways. For example, a person in the residential architecture business narrates his
experience wherein he was required to compare estimates from 3 different contractors each of
whom employed varied schemas and methodologies for doing computations. The
aforementioned person, who assumedly must have been head of his company, contends that the
human brain is more adept at doing comparisons and contrasts in such scenarios where the
information is not standardized and cannot be input into a spreadsheet.
In light of the above, it does become evident that a clash between traditionality and
modernity comes in the way of businesses being able to realize the full benefits of generative AI.
People stuck in the old ways of doing business would suffer at the expense of modern
corporations that can leverage generative content to drive their growth."

idea for achieving strategic benefits for an
organization. The most challenging will be
adding the human appeal to the software. Ai can
already answer many of our questions and give
us valuable data for many of our complex issues.
But it doesn’t yet have the important human
appeal to it. There are many times where I will
ask chat gpt a question and the answer isn’t quite
what I’m looking for so I have to continue to

is because it is still very new and in the initial
stages of it’s development. In the next few
decades and maybe even as short as in the next
few years the software will become so advanced
that it will be indistinguishable from being a
computer generated software and a real human.

The main issue currently is that it is only able to pull information from other information that
already exists. For example if I want it to generate me an essay about something, it is unable to
generate something completely new that fits my personality of writing. It pulls other essays from
the internet that already exist to draft it. So plagiarism is a major issue currently facing the

achieving strategic benefits for an organization? According to an understanding I got
on Quora, although artificial intelligence (AI) seems very convenient, it must be used
correctly.
Generative AI models require large amounts of data to learn, and companies that do
not have access to sufficient data or data formats will face challenges. And companies
need to consider the time and money invested in AI modules because they are
complex and expensive. They also need to hire knowledge-related professionals.
Companies also need to consider whether the data being generated is what they want
it to be and be aware of whether the data being generated raises ethical issues such as
forgery or the generation of harmful or biased content.
Finally, organizations may need to apply complex AI models to existing workflows
and processes."
1038,S0078,4,"I believe that there are many different challenges that an organization can face when
applying generative AI to an innovative idea. With any new implementation, there can be
many challenges such as how the users will react to the new system. Change can be
quite difficult for some users and reduce the strategic benefits for an organization. It may
take users a good amount of time to understand the new system as well as how to use
the system the correct way. Additionally, if a new system is implemented then many
processes must change in order to be used in accordance with the new system. This will
continue to take even longer on top of the user training because making a large change
requires a great amount of time. Another key challenge is the cost to implement
Generative AI. Since Generative AI is a relatively new system, it may not be as
optimized and cost efficient as companies may hope. The upfront cost can be quite large
and an important decision has to be made if an organization would like to apply
Generative AI to an innovative idea to achieve strategic benefits. If organizations can get
past these key challenges, then Generative AI will prove itself as a very beneficial
implementation and potentially provide strategic benefits."
1039,S0079,4,"Question 4: The main challenge when applying generative AI for strategic purposes in an
organization is the possible legal and ethical issues it can bring in. Organizations need to be
aware of these and have a plan on how to prevent any issues that can come at a high cost and

outweigh the benefit of having generative AI used for strategic purposes. The issue of security
and data privacy is always the problem with emerging technology. Is the generative AI safe from
any potential breaches? Is the data of the generative AI private and protected? When it comes to
integrating any technology into an organization the issue of employees actually using the
technology arises. They need to be willing to use it and learn how to use it properly. This is
easier said than done and can take months to implement. You may also need to hire new people
who are already familiar with generative AI but since it is still a very new technology there is a
very limited pool of talent. Generative AI is an expensive technology to implement. It has to be
right for your organization and the organization’s needs, or else it will be a waste of money and
time."
1040,S0080,4,"Based on some of the answers in a thread to this question, I believe one of the largest challenges is
keeping users&#39; information and data private. These programs are constantly sending reports to
engineers, and a user plugging in certain information, while it may seem harmless, in the wrong
hands could be catastrophic. While automated, these programs have users researching and looking at
how prompts respond to given information. If something that could potentially put someone at risk is
included, it may not be any better. I know that AI has parameters set up not to push anything illegal
or explicit out, but no program is perfect, and users may begin to plug information in to see what
they can get out of it. Another issue brought up in the thread is intellectual property issues. Suppose
the system is pulling from so many different websites, and users are not putting correct sources or
citing works. When does one person&#39;s intellectual property become another&#39;s when generated by AI?
Whenever I use ChatGPT or another AI program, I make sure that I am giving it enough information
so that it is still me creating most of what is in the output response. I usually give it anywhere from 1
to 3 paragraphs worth of information, telling it to cite specific things, adding in tone, or even giving
it a sample of my own writing to go off. I rarely copy something 100% and send it or post it as is.
From a business standpoint, I believe that most AI-generated responses are robotic and lack a
personal touch; thus, I always edit for my audience."
1041,S0081,4,"Question 4-
One of the challenges of generative AI is the data. Generative AI requires large amounts of high-
quality and diverse data to train and evaluate the AI models. Collecting, labeling, and processing
data can be expensive and difficult. Some data may be scarce, sensitive, or protected by
copyright or privacy laws, which limits the availability and accessibility of the data. Therefore,
generative AI users need to find ways to acquire, manage, and use the data effectively and
ethically.
Generative AI also requires a high degree of maintenance and upkeep. Not every organization
has the money or expertise to maintain effective AI on a new idea. Maintaining AI data security,
infrastructure, and everything else will require a team of experts that not every business will have
or can afford.
Adding on, AI relies on information from humans. If that information is biased, innovation is
slowed and productive ideas can be lost."
1042,S0082,4,"Applying generative AI to an innovative idea poses some key challenges. Generative AI systems do not always produce high quality outputs. Sometimes these outputs contain errors like an image was blurred or an image was discolored. Systems can create harmful content that would be negative for an organization. Computational sources may be needed like storage or memory. If an organization deals with creating videos a lot, they need high resolution and realistic content. Organizations need to ensure they have sufficient and scalable computational resources to support the generative AI they are using. Generative AI can inherit and amplify biases within data. An AI that creates faces can be skewed towards nose structure versus another and therefore messes up facial recognition. This helps to avoid discrimination and be fairer. Generative AI can be difficult to explain and understand sometimes. Organizations need to make sure their AI is transparent and accountable so that they can provide explanations for the outputs that are put out in order for those to digest what is occurring from within these deep neural networks. Safety and security concerns can arise when implementing these ideas. Safeguards and policies need to be in place to prevent or mitigate any threats an organization may face when using generative AI to help enhance their strategy.  "
1043,S0083,4,"There are many challenges when applying generative AI to an innovative idea for achieving
strategic benefits for an organization, there can be problems with security, costs, maintenance,
quality control, and much more. In one subreddit that I read, they were listing different scenarios
where companies' AI models were discriminatory in some way. One example of that can be with
Amazon when they experimented with AI to construct a resume screening tool with the goal of
boosting the efficiency of sorting to streamline the process of sorting job applications but the
screening algorithm tended to filter only male candidates. Although Amazon didn&#39;t use it, they
would have many issues with discrimination if they did. Artificial intelligence learns from data
and therefore can inherit biases. Another example is Google’s image recognition software which
increased its racial discrimination by referring to two people with dark complexion as “gorillas”.
Even though they apologized, it was not resolved and there was no progress."
1044,S0084,4,"There are many key challenges when it comes to applying generative AI to an innovative idea for
achieving strategic benefits for an organization. The first one is data privacy/security.
Organizations must ensure that sensitive/personal data is safe and won’t be used in malicious or
harmful ways. They also have to make sure that their data is protected from unauthorized users
who may try to steal their personal information. A second key challenge would be to ensure that
the systems that they plan to use are capable of the amount of data and complex processes
required for generative AI to perform effectively and efficiently. A third key challenge would be
the legal and ethical issues that we mentioned in the previous questions. Organizations must be
wary of the problems that could arise from their use of generative AI. They must surround
themselves with a team and experts that can help them use generative AI in the best way
possible.
Another challenge that may not be as apparent as the others is for these organizations to find the
balance between this new age technologies and the techniques of the past. Organizations could
be quick to see that the introduction of generative AI will help them save on cost, resources, and
time. However, is it actually worth it if they have to sacrifice quality and remove the human
aspect that makes so many different brands/companies stand out. It is all about finding that
perfect balance where they can effectively use generative AI and still maintain what makes their
company a company which is the humans."
1045,S0085,4,"Through the responses from my community I found multiple challenges that can occur when
applying generative AI to an innovative idea to achieve strategic benefits for an organization. One of the
challenges that were discussed was “managing job displacement due to automation.” This challenge has
been a concern for a while now and it is an understandable concern. Generative AI is able to take an idea
and produce the wanted outcome significantly faster than human employees. Not only does this reduce
the amount of time it takes to finish the job, but it is also cost efficient as well. Another challenge that was
introduced was the potential output of an AI can be seen as biased. Generative AI takes the data and
information from online to create its results. Along with this, if the information that is found is “unfair”
then the result produced will likely be biased. This is a significant challenge for any organization as they
could potentially be applying “biased output” to their strategic plans. Ensuring user adoption with
integrating generative AI into an already existing workflow was another challenge that was mentioned.

When a system is set in a work environment, it may be challenging to introduce an additional or a new
technique. It will take time for employees to be able to adapt, which makes it important for the employers
to be consistent with ensuring that the added step/technique is being utilized."
1046,S0086,4,"There are many challenges involved when using Generative AI to create new and useful ideas.
- As I mentioned before, Generative AI models use big and good-quality datasets for effective
training. Obtaining, cleaning, and maintaining such datasets can be a substantial challenge.
- To process such amounts of information, organizations will need significant computational
resources, which is extremely costly.
- Also, getting people to like and trust AI can be hard. User concerns about data security, job
displacement, or the reliability of AI-generated outputs must be another big challenge.
- Integrating Generative AI solutions into an organization's existing IT infrastructure and
workflows can be complex and may require substantial changes or customizations.
- Figuring out the right balance between human and AI involvement in decision-making processes
is crucial. Organizations need to determine how Generative AI can augment human capabilities
rather than replace them.
- Assessing the cost-effectiveness of Generative AI initiatives and measuring their impact on
strategic objectives can be challenging, particularly in the absence of well-established metrics.
- Organizations must stay aware of the competitive landscape, as AI innovations can quickly
become commoditized. Maintaining a competitive edge requires ongoing investment in R&D.
Navigating these challenges requires a strategic approach, including thorough planning, continuous
monitoring, ethical considerations, and a commitment to staying current with technological
advancements and regulatory changes. Successful implementation of Generative AI in pursuit of
strategic benefits necessitates a holistic and adaptable strategy that aligns innovation with the
organization's values and objectives."
1047,S0087,4,"There can be some flaws to applying generative AI to produce innovative ideas for achieving
strategic benefits for an organization such as limitations to accuracy and complex situations. For
instance, when using AI to generate strategic benefits for your company, it could be difficult to
get the AI to conform to what you are looking for which demonstrates the limitations to how
niche an AI can produce work. When a company is looking for niche answers to their problems,
it could be difficult for the AI to generate an accurate solution without prior knowledge of the
niche topic. Another example of some key challenges that may be presented when using AI to
generate benefits can be seen through data source training and getting the AI to accurately
program data to produce answers for complex data. The more data an AI encounters, the more
complex it can get which can lead to less effective productivity with the use of AI. Another
challenge I saw users report is getting the AI to effectively incorporate business terminology in
order to get their message across. Along with this, when users reported using AI to help generate
content, they have reported instances of AI producing malicious code to initiate viruses which
can be extremely dangerous for an industry."
1048,S0088,4,"Applying generative AI for strategic benefits in organizations can be very beneficial. However, it
does come with several key challenges. First, making sure that the data used for training is
accurate and quality is crucial. The AI&#39;s outputs are very dependent on the quality and
representativeness of the training data. The generator depends very much on the quality of data
to create effective content. Feeding the generator any biased or inaccurate information can affect
the AI’s output. Addressing biases in AI-generated content is another huge challenge, as these
biases can lead to ethical issues. It can also threaten the credibility and integrity of the content
produced. Another key challenge that many people are afraid of is potential job displacement due
to AI. This is a very real concern, as certain roles involving simple tasks may become obsolete.
Figuring out a balance between automation and human involvement is essential for the
successful implementation of AI, as humans are needed to monitor and adapt the AI system over
time. It also requires adapting workflows and providing training to employees to integrate
generative AI effectively into existing processes. Generative AI has great potential, but
organizations must address these challenges in order to achieve strategic benefits."
1049,S0089,4,"One of the key challenges when applying generative AI to an innovative idea for
achieving strategic benefits for an organization is knowing how to balance it. By this I
mean that generative AI can be very useful in an organization but becoming too
dependant on it can be detrimental. As mentioned before, generative AI can boost
creativity by allowing employees to focus less on more simple jobs. However, depending
entirely on generative AI to do all of the work, completely removes human creativity.
Knowing that it is a tool and not a solution is the key when choosing to use generative AI
in an organization. With integrating generative AI into a workplace, comes the need to
adapt to this change which is another challenge within itself. Employees would need to

change the ways they were working previously in order to have generative AI function in
their favor. This would take new training and changes in processes.
Another challenge is that generative AI could lead to a mass displacement of workers.
This would be in industries that are highly automatable. Since this technology has the
ability to do jobs that humans can do, it may eventually lead to people not being needed
for these positions. Technology is also more consistent in doing automatable procedures,
which further supports this challenge."
1050,S0090,4,"o The key challenges are when applying generative AI to an innovative idea are
getting the organization to trust the results. People are already skeptical to rely on
AI, which increases the concern for organization to stray away from using this
resource. Organizations are unsure of the data being input to create these patterns,
so it would they would need to validate the data to give their trust to AI. Not only
is trust an issue, but people fear job security. Employees fear that AI will take
their jobs due to the fast-paced results that they can’t match. Although AI still
needs humans to help the beginning and end of the process, AI in the workplace
would eliminate many job opportunities. There are various jobs that organizations

can replace with AI at a much cheaper cost. On top of that, the AI networks have
no loyalty to organizations. Companies are providing their data not considering
what that would provide other with. Who is to say that originations won’t get their
data leaked to their rivals? There is a large lack of trust between generative AI
networks and organizations. This may be solved by providing organizations with
legal contracts with AI networks or their personal AI network to trust in."
1051,S0091,4,"a. To summarize, the creator of the thread “ChatGPT in a business office
environment”, is curious on how generative is possibly utilized in an
organizational setting. Judging from the comments on the thread, the people
typically utilize generative AI for repetitive, simple tasks. For example, one of the
commenters used ChatGPT in order to generate fake data for tables and
databases. I believe the key challenges when applying generative AI to an
innovative idea is understanding the limitations of generative AI when it comes to
an innovative idea. Users typically use it for generally tedious tasks or in order to
gain insight on their current tasks. To add on, one of the users on the thread
stated: “My biggest problem is that we aren’t allowed to use chatgpt at work
because of security concerns”. I believe that it is safe to conclude that another
key challenge when applying generative AI to an innovative idea is the overall
security of generative AI. Considering that this user’s company disallowed
generative AI proves that generative AI shows a security risk when applying it
and could potentially pose a risk to your innovative idea. Although these
challenges may arise when attempting to use generative AI to benefit ideas for
your organization; it is safe to say that generative AI is an amazing tool to utilize
for tedious tasks."
1052,S0092,4,"Although generative AI presents significant opportunities when applied innovatively by
organizations, several challenges are evident when examining its use in advertising–a sector
that's rapidly adopting this new technology. Take concerns surrounding bias, for instance.
Generative AI creates content based on the data it’s fed, yet if that data is biased, the AI might
amplify these biases by diffusing them into the broader digital landscape. In a strategic context,
such biases could misrepresent an organization's intent and even lead to public relations issues
or legal repercussions. Another challenge is copyright infringement. As AI crafts new content,
there’s a risk it might unknowingly create derivative works. This can unintentionally infringe upon
existing copyright material, leading to legal disputes and damaging an organization&#39;s
reputation–especially if such content becomes widely circulated. Data protection is another issue.
Because generative AI often requires vast amounts of data for its operation, there&#39;s potential for
misuse or breaches, which will naturally undermine stakeholder trust. Amidst these challenges,
there&#39;s a growing demand from advertisers for more transparency around the organizational
application of AI–a clear sign that balancing innovation and ethical considerations is tricky
business. Some companies have proactively revised contracts and developed internal AI-use
frameworks, which underscores the importance of setting clear boundaries when leveraging
generative AI for strategic gains. In summary, to address the challenges posed by generative AI,
organizations are emphasizing transparency, establishing clear contractual terms, and promoting
open dialogue about the responsible usage of this new technology."
1053,S0093,4,"Aside from the ethical and cybersecurity issues that arise when applying generative AI to
an innovative idea, there is also the issue of technical expertise and data quality. For example, if

a company is using generative AI to create a social media post or a campaign, there is a chance
that the AI generated ideas may fall flat. There is a chance that the campaign may not be as
interesting or may not be as engaging as the company may have hoped. Furthermore, there is the
issue of data quality and quantity. In order generative AI to be effective, the user may have to
give a lot of information. This could be an issue if the user needs to receive the data quickly or
they do not understand that the Generative AI needs a proper amount of information in order to
give out good information."
1054,S0094,4,"If you are a preexisting company and been around for a while, it may be a big challenge
applying generative AI into an organization existing workflow. This may cause a lot of changes
in the company and a lot of frustration and time in the beginning or start of the transition from
not using generative AI to using generative AI. The employees would probably have to do some
training with the AI because most likely there will be a change in processes. So that will be time
consuming and maybe costly. The cost of applying the generative AI program into your
organization may be a key challenge as well. Also, the likeliness of the generative AI program
from an employee’s stand point. The employees may not like the generative AI and feel like it
may not be useful. So, the key challenge would be making your employees happy with the AI
because if the organization just tells them to deal with it then they may have another issue with
employee production, attitude, and just may not respond well. Another key factor is that you
will have to hire someone with that type of expertise, meaning even though you save money
and time on productivity, you will have to be financially good to bring another salary on board."
1055,S0095,4,"The post mentioned that some of the key challenges when applying generative AI to an
innovative idea for achieving strategic benefits for an organization can include addressing
biases in AI output, workflow challenges and finding that balance between AI involvement and
human involvement is key for implementing
AI in an organization. Like I mentioned
before in the previous post, organizations
need to overcome the challenges of
limitations in AI models, specifically
skewed/biased data. Biased data can be
present in the training data like any machine
learning models. If it’s not properly
addressed then it can generate biased
output that can impact the whole
organization. For example, skewed data
towards a specific demographic which can
show lack of diversity and in this day and
age of inclusivity, it will impact the
organization in a negative light. Which is
why organizations need to train the AI in
diversifying data. The second point is overcoming
challenges of the first step in integrating AI systems
in workplaces, which can disrupt the workflow. They
would need to modify their existing systems to
accommodate for the new generative AI system.
Employees would also need to be trained on how to
use it, which means that organizations need to
allocate their resources into training the employees.
Lastly, organizations would need to find the balance
between when to use AI and when to use human
resources. They need to be able to determine the
appropriate level of generative AI without
undermining the role of humans."
1056,S0096,4,"When applying generative AI to an innovative idea for achieving strategic benefits for an
organization, key challenges include implementation, data quality, and potential job
displacement. Generative AI is a new way of creating content and information that needs to be
implemented correctly within the operations of an organization to successfully utilize the
generated content in serving its users or customers. Implementing generative AI into existing
workflows can be a challenge for workers to adapt to if it deals with a change in processes or
training. Finding an efficient way to integrate AI within their operations that will not disrupt their
existing workflow can serve as a beneficial method to create better solutions.
Data or content produced with generative AI must be of high quality to achieve strategic benefits
in an organization, and they must ensure that data is accurate and unbiased. Data used to train the
model, or where data is sourced to generate content is also important to consider. Data that
generative AI uses should be relevant to the organization&#39;s strategic plan to produce useful
content that will benefit them. Potential job displacement is a challenge some organizations may
face when applying generative AI to their strategy because in some situations it can automate
tasks previously performed by workers. The automation of various tasks causes worker
displacement, but it also has the potential to create new jobs adapted to maintaining and
innovating with AI. Finding an optimal balance between generative AI and human involvement
can combat these challenges to achieve strategic benefits within an organization."
1057,S0097,4,"Beside the issues declared earlier, Generative AI takes a lot of effort to train, so it will be
difficult for organizations to use the AI if they are unprepared and don’t have said proper data.
Furthermore, there is also the danger that the data used to train Generative AI are a high
privacy concern to users. It will also take a lot of effort to keep the AI running and improving, so
the assets included within the Generative AI domain would have to include the actual machinery
and maintenance. Also, when it comes to innovations, this concept are based on helping the
user’s emotional response when using an organization’s specific services and/or products.
While an AI might use some form of data to try to interpret user insights, there needs to be an
element of human connection in order to make innovations for users more effective. As said
before, it is also a risk using other pieces of data and information from other people and
sources. Using Generative AI in the innovation process, such as creating product/services
designs, may risk being too similar to other pieces of source data that the AI trained with.
Plagiarism and idea/copyright infringement risks are apparent due to this. When it comes to
Generative AI, it is very important not to fully rely on its service and functionality, but it still
should be an effective tool to assisting in guiding organizations in their practices."
1058,S0098,4,"What appears to be one of the greater challenges of applying generative AI is adopting
the technology into your current system. Considering that the prior system is going to be
older and less advanced it can prove challenging to integrate AI into that system without
having to completely uproot the whole thing and start from the beginning. Another
challenge when integrating AI is having the data to allow it to perform to its maximum
capability. This entails having a large dataset for it to learn from as well as having the
proper security measures to protect this data set. Having a well-planned out strategy to
integrate the system will also be crucial. It will not be free to integrate this system so
understanding all the associated costs on implementation is important but thankfully there
is tremendous upside after you complete the process. In order to integrate AI you will
need people who are trained and familiar with the programming. This may be employees
a business already has, or this may require seeking out trained individuals and paying
them to do it for you. There is going to be a high demand for employees with these
qualifications so naturally you are going to need to make your business more attractive to
people like this."
1059,S0099,4,"One of the challenges currently facing the insurance industry, as illustrated in the example I
provided in a previous question regarding telematics, is the acquisition of sufficient data. At
present, there is a relative scarcity of data available. However, as time progresses and an
increasing number of drivers enroll in telematics programs, our capacity to predict underwriting
risk more accurately will expand. This concept aligns closely with the law of large numbers; the
greater the quantity and scope of data in our dataset, the more precise our AI systems will
become in forecasting risk.

Another pressing challenge we encounter pertains to people&#39;s reluctance to participate in such
programs. Many individuals are wary of the notion of &quot;big brother&quot; monitoring their every
movement. Nevertheless, as more insurance companies embrace this model, the dataset will
naturally grow. This expansion occurs as the pool of insurance providers not utilizing telematics
diminishes, compelling customers to choose from a progressively smaller set of options as this
technology gains wider adoption.
Even after this AI model accrues sufficient data, organizations continue to grapple with the time
and cost required for successful implementation. However, I firmly believe that being among
the first companies to embrace this model will grant the insurance company a competitive
advantage over its counterparts, catapulting it into the future ahead of the competition.

I must mention that AI is already being used to assist in underwriting risk. The data offered by
telematics will enable us to enhance the precision of our underwriting risk predictions by
providing additional information derived from our customers&#39; driving habits."
1060,S0100,4,"I again asked ChatGPT this question as I am curious on how AI thinks when it comes to
problems and solutions. I was given the longest list yet with eleven considerations about its flaws
and how to fix them. These eleven considerations are data quality and quantity, bias and fairness,
explainability and transparency, legal and regulatory compliance, ethical considerations, security
risk, lack of expertise, cost and resource constraints, change management, long-term
maintenance, and user acceptance. It was interesting to see that a lot of these considerations are
related to legal and ethical considerations that were brought up in question three. Lack of
expertise was interesting to see as AI is available but not everyone is an expert in setting it up to
provide legal and ethical outcomes and AI is suggesting it needs experts of AI to control it. This
leads to future considerations that a degree in AI will be a degree people can obtain. Another
new one would be the long-term maintenance of AI as it understands it needs to be updated and
monitored or it will cause problems. AI wants to be maintained by people to keep doing what it
does. AI brings up security considerations also and AI is recommending encryption and extra
security measures to be put in place, so it is protected from any attacks."
1061,S0101,4,"Generative AI is an interface that uses data to solve company’s issues and help keep it sustainable
for the future. Generative AI can be a major factor when it comes to decision making in real time
for something significant, while also allowing for improvements on decisions that have already
been made previously. It can be used to cut labor costs and actually save a company money if the
correct and most viable options are made through it. If labor costs were to be cut, it would mean
that lots of people would be losing their jobs to an AI that can do their jobs more efficiently, and
this is a huge problem in a lot of industries because a lot of workers could lose their jobs, which
could even lead to a spiral in the economy."
1062,S0102,4,"The following issues must be overcome when using generative AI to implement an
original concept for an organization's strategic gains:
● Data quantity and quality: To train generative AI models, a lot of high-quality
data is needed. The generative AI model won't be able to produce accurate and
trustworthy results if the company doesn't have access to enough data or if the
data is of poor quality.
● Model explainability and reliability: It might be challenging to trust the output
of generative AI models and to comprehend how they operate. This is as a result
of the complexity and opacity of generative AI models. To deploy generative AI
models effectively, organizations need to be able to explain how they function
and have confidence in their output.
● Organizations may encounter a number of additional difficulties while utilizing
generative AI to implement a novel concept, such as the following:● Technical knowledge: The area of generative AI is complicated and quickly
developing. For generative AI models to be created, trained, and used,
organizations must possess the necessary technical skills.
Despite these obstacles, generative AI has the power to completely transform a wide range
of markets and corporate operations. Organizations will be well-positioned to obtain
strategic benefits and acquire a competitive advantage if they can successfully use
generative AI to novel concepts."
1063,S0103,4,"The key challenges that comes with applying generative AI to an innovative idea for achieving strategic benefits are plenty such as; data quality and availability, ethical regulatory compliance, cybersecurity and bias justification. Programming to get data into and decisions out, Computer power for training and the limitations of ai being that it's often wrong, required exponentially more data and computer power the more complex the situation is. Data quantity and quality is the most important aspect to focus on. Generative AI models require large, high-quality datasets for effective training. It can take a lot of time and money to collect and analyze such data for specialized or proprietary applications. As for specifically ethical and bias, organizations must apply strict bias detection and mitigation strategies in order to ensure fairness and equity in AI-generated content or decisions. When generative AI is used for innovation and strategic advantages, problems with data quality, moral considerations, model transparency, cybersecurity risks, and organizational adaptation arise. Regarding cybersecurity, generative AI can be used for purposes such as creating deepfake substance or causing phishing attacks, so it is vital to prioritize security to prevent such issues. Therefore, all the organizations should set clear objectives in risk assesments, and set regulations to keep data in check, as well as to maintain monitoring on the share of data across. 


"
1064,S0104,4,"In terms of the main, key challenges, a reoccurring theme is seen within the threads: job replacement- question of stability- and the issue of ethical and justifiable usage. As stated before, and by the pattern that has emerged within this thread, it is clear society members are most torn over these two issues, creating the basis of what difficulties companies will face when trying to target “correctly” or “approvingly.” It will be hard for companies to appeal to both sides, as they are on the polar opposite ends of one another, so they will only really be able to target one sort of individual: the one who supports the usage of AI over human labor or the one who supports human labor over generative AI. Based on perspective, many agree that AI will simplify so many processes for humans, helping us move past trivial issues and tasks to focus on better honing our true skills; others refuse to see eye-to-eye thinking about the risks attached to robotic machines overpowering human capabilities and dulling the future of our workforce. With this, it may be difficult for management to implement policies and strategies that support one side of this spectrum, whilst employees sit on the other. The same thing can be said for managers and their higherups, such as CEOs and the board of directors. It can be hard to fully support and call into action ideas when team members stand divided amongst themselves due to moral, ethical dilemmas and the fear of losing all that provides for them (and potentially their families). "
1065,S0105,4,"The key challenges that exist when applying generative AI to an innovation include system
integration and talent acquisition. Integrating AI into an idea within an organization can be
difficult because there are systems that have already been built so there needs to be system
integration with the AI to ensure it works seamlessly alongside all other existing systems. And in
order to ensure everything is set up accordingly and running smoothly after the fact, there needs
to be someone whom oversees the system. Talent acquisition with AI can be challenging as
there are not many professionals that are experienced with AI."
1066,S0106,4," I think that some of the key challenges that are currently in the way of generative AI
include accuracy. When talking about the utilization of GPT 4/3.5, it won’t be able to
provide useful information beyond what it can infer in regards to the context you have
provided. If your organization is using new manuals that have not been curated on the
internet, then chatGPT will have problems filling in the gaps. LLMs are known to give
incorrect information, but confidently relay the information, leading to misinformation.
An LLM is unable to differentiate between what it knows and what it doesn’t, leading to
this scenario where it pumps out information that is only partially correct. I think another
challenge regarding generative AI, is the worry of data confidentiality. I think that AI is
unpredictable, and we have no idea if it will share our data with other users. We can
freely implement our own information retrieval, like a document database. However,
implementing new structures into the AI model can warp the infrastructure of the
software itself, and lead to issues regarding data collection and analysis."
1067,S0107,4,"Applying generative AI to innovative ideas for strategic benefits in organizations presents several key challenges. These challenges encompass data requirements, model development, ethical concerns, and alignment with strategic goals. Ensuring the AI model’s accuracy and training it with relevant data is extremely challenging. It is important to carefully evaluate the AI’s outputs and determine whether there are unintended biases and consequences. Ethics also plays a major role in implementing generative AI within organizations through job displacement. However, there are things that organizations can do in order to address these major challenges. One thing that could be done is to start off small, rather than rushing to apply AI wherever they can. Organizations could begin by applying generative AI to smaller, manageable problems to gain experience and assess potential benefits and risks. Continuous monitoring could also help an organization implement generative AI. Regularly monitoring AI model performance, acknowledging its limitations, and making necessary adjustments along the way could prove to be extremely beneficial to an organization. Despite the challenges, generative AI has immense potential to transform product development, operational efficiency, and decision-making in organizations. To take full advantage of these benefits, organizations must navigate these challenges strategically, stay ethical, and maintain vigilance throughout the process."
1068,S0108,4,"There are many many challenges when it comes to applying generative artificial intelligence to an innovative idea. Its similar to how it was back in the day when we first discovered coding. Coding was 1’s and 0’s, and everyone who wanted to code anything had to start from scratch. Nowadays we have shortcuts and ways to make everything easier. That is soon how it will be with generative AI, where we can quickly apply it to an innovative idea and it can do the work for us, but so far we still have the work cut out for us. We need to discover what we can do with it first before we can put shortcuts on it. Not only that, but the technology needs to be fully developed before we can start doing that. Even then we still have to wait for people to learn how to use it. In the picture above it shows an AI results which clearly serves no benefit to humans and looks like it messed up somewhere along. The guy that responds has a good point, explaining its the people that ask the questions are dumb(Is it really though). Like when computers came around, people had no idea how to use them, we have to wait for everyone to learn how to use artificial intelligence. So once we have fully developed programs, and once the short cuts are created, and once people know how to use these shorts cuts, there might be less problems when it comes to applying generative artificial intelligence to an innovative product. Until then there are still a lot of difficulties and unknown with this technology. Like the computer though, soon hopefully we will be able to apply it to innovative ideas. 


"
1069,S0109,4,"There are a few key challenges for organizations when applying generative AI to an innovative idea. One of the challenges is the possibility of misinformation.  Generative AI can produce wrong information if it is unable to interpret information, if there are technological constraints, creating made up facts  due to its training or lack of understanding for things in the real world. Another challenge is using copyrighted information as I mentioned above. Generative AI models take most of its information from preexisited information from the internet or its trained to make predictions. Because the AI is using information already existing, even if the software you are using grants you privileges or rights to the generated information, this information is still subjected to being copied from another source..  In an example found from Reddit, the graphic novel Zarya of the Dawn created a copyright dispute because the main character used generative AI to illustrate his copic book. In February 2023 the author lost his copyright protection for the illustrations in his comic book because it was not human-created work. This case shows that designs or artwork created with generative AI may not be subjected to copyright protection and could result in theft of creative ideas."
1070,S0110,4,"There are many key challenges when applying generative AI because it does need a lot of data to produce information, so you want to make sure the data that is being prompt from the generative AI matches the organizations and goals it is trying to achieve. Using generative AI can be time consuming and intensive learning how to use properly and can take away from being innovative. It can also be hard to understand how the generative AI prompts its data making it hard to get deeper information or better understanding for the AI’s prompts. It can also be expensive to use generative AI and organizations must consider if it is worth it to use AI for their company. Generative AI won’t do all the work when having innovative ideas, but it is a tool that help and take organizations to another level. It will still require employees to learn and innovate on their own."
1071,S0111,4,NaN
1072,S0112,4,"	Key challenges exist in applying AI, as challenges typically arise whenever we try to implement a new strategy. I’ll revisit the AI for customer service example. Here it was integrating with existing software that proved particularly difficult. The example the Reddit poster provided seems so simple, but also the reasoning behind it makes sense.
	When a customer submits a ticket to unsubscribe from marketing emails, the issue has to be escalated to a human – generative AI cannot remove the customer on its own. The reason for this is permissions; the company does not grant generative AI permission to read or write sensitive customer data within marketing or sales platforms. Interestingly enough, the same is true for most of their live customer service agents as well. Access to the email marketing system is only granted to higher level employees.
	Maintaining quality of customer interaction would be a big initial concern. Another challenge that could exist is customer trust; given the choice, should an organization disclose to customers that AI is being utilized? If they don’t and the customer finds out, repercussions could be huge. Also, using generative AI means staying up to date with new versions, monitoring security issues, and ensuring you have appropriately trained staff to manage the software.
"
1073,S0113,4,"Some of the hardest parts about applying AI to an organization is a lot of what we have previously talked about. First, finding a service that works well for your company can be challenging. There are many easily accessible sites online that can be accessed for free but you want something you know you can trust with your sensitive company data. This further goes into security risks. The more automated your organization the more damage a hack can have. If the main functions of your company are through AI and it goes down it will be a huge halt. Next was the legal and ethical concerns. You would have to do a lot of prep and research into what laws are in place about AI and how to avoid future issues that may arise. You would need to inform your customers about what AI is used for in your company which might be a deterrent to some future customers."
1074,S0114,4,"The final question was the most difficult to research just using the community, and the linked 
blog post above will also help me answer some of it. A good Generative AI basically needs the 
right data, or enough data for it to come up with adequate answers. Sometimes, within 
organizations especially, there isn’t enough to go off on with normal humans making decisions. 
Another issue is integration as there are many employees who may feel like they don’t need to 
use the tool or are training a replacement. The bigger challenge here is implementing it in such a 
way that doesn’t feel intrusive or required. There’s also the issue of data privacy and protections, 
since Generative AI needs a lot and often it can be an issue for certain users with the amount it 
collects. There’s also the infamous issue of bias within AI, and more importantly, the fact that it 
can hallucinate answers from nothing to maintain content or conversation. Overall, there are 
many challenges with getting this technology within the workplace, to the point where some may 
even decide to avoid it entirely in the meantime.  
 "
1075,S0115,4,". Some challenges when applying generative AI to an innovative idea for achieving strategic benefits for an organizations can be the ethical practices, data quantity, biases, and discriminatory outcomes. Also can rely heavily on your expectations of the innovation of idea. When using AI to generate a new idea, it is important to include enough ethical data that is relevant and true to what you are seeking. The goal is to eliminate any biases that could be generated, so that the outcome is fair.
"
1076,S0116,4,"	Within AI, there is the obvious appeal of efficiency that the design will bring; however, there are still reasons to why many companies have not gone upon the route of AI generation within their organization, many involving the issues faced to achieve strategic benefits. A key reason that I took away was the ethical side of the story when dealing with this form of Ai with its potential to take people out of jobs from being more efficient. Maybe the company gets backlash, or maybe it doesn’t—but the key factor within this dilemma is not having the full human accessibility when using AI to cut costs. How to public views your company is very essential to a business’ success, so being perceived as the company that let go of its workers to pursue AI over giving people jobs can put a bad reputation on your brand. Another issues that is important to discuss would be the pricing that the incorporation to an organization may entail. Paying for the AI systems alone may take a lot, but you also need to train people to use them and become familiarized, with possible other unexpected costs that could make the current state of AI not worth it."
1077,S0117,4,"There are three key challenges when applying generative AI to an innovative idea for achieving strategic benefits. Challenge 1 is the quality and the quantity of the data fed into the AI. If the organization does not have sufficient data to input it would be challenging for the AI to output anything of use. Challenge 2 is Model Explainability and trustworthiness. How Generative AI work isn't something your average person understands fully. Organizations will need to be able to explain the AI in layman's terms so that there can be a trust established. Challenge 3 is what was discussed in the previous question and that is the ethical and legal concerns. Besides the issue of inputted data being other people's original works there is the issue of deepfakes as well. Being able to completely manipulate a video to have somebody's face and even in some advanced cases their voice as well and the potential for ethical issues arising from such content can cause issues for organizations or the use of generative AI as a whole. Other smaller issues include the technical expertise needed to run a generative AI, the cost of running the AI, and the integration of the AI in an organization."
1078,S0118,4,"Some of the key challenges when applying AI in a innovative idea will be that there might be a lack of talent and expertise. Building and deploying generative AI models requires skilled data scientists, machine learning engineers, and domain experts. The only solution for this would be to invest in talent acquisition, training, and collaboration between AI experts and domain specialists. Users may also be hesitant on using AI and becoming adapted to the idea of using AI. Users may be resistant to AI generated content, especially in areas requiring high trust. The solution to this would be to implement user education and communication strategies to build trust and promote the benefits of AI generated solutions. Not only that but also thinking about the cost and ROI of AI will be very challenging as well. Developing, deploying, and maintaining generative AI systems can be costly and organizations need to justify the investment. The solution for this would be to conduct a cost benefit analysis to assess the potential ROI and long term value of generative AI projects. Addressing these challenges requires a thoughtful and strategic approach to the implementation of generative AI with the focus of ethical considerations, transparency, and ongoing monitoring and improvement. Collaboration between technical and non-technical teams is also crucial to align generative AI initiatives with organizational goals."

1080,S0120,4,"The practical challenges of using generative AI in organizations, especially when it comes to
innovative ideas. Firstly, these AI models hunger for lots of data to learn and perform well. If an
organization doesn't have enough data or if it's not in a suitable format, it can pose a problem.
Secondly, creating and using generative AI models is intricate and can be costly. It requires
expertise in areas like machine learning, data science, and software engineering. Thirdly,
grasping how these AI models operate and why they produce specific results can be quite
puzzling. This lack of transparency can make it hard to trust them, especially when important
decisions are involved. Fourthly, ethical concerns surround generative AI. It has the potential to
generate content like deep fake videos or biased materials, which raises substantial ethical
questions. On top of these general challenges, applying generative AI to different innovative
ideas can bring unique hurdles. For example, if an organization wants to use it for a new product,
they must ensure the AI's results align with their goals, verify its accuracy, and integrate it
smoothly into their existing processes. Despite these challenges, there's a growing interest in
leveraging generative AI to help organizations become more creative, efficient, and effective
decision-makers. It could significantly reshape how organizations operate and innovate."
1081,S0121,4,"The key challenges when applying AI to an innovative idea is talent retention, fairness, and ethical and legal concerns. In the music industry, the Grammy Awards have decided not to accept AI generated content because it disregards the professionals who put in work and time to create a song. They ended up changing their original response to as long as the artists created 20% of the work. This led to creators and artists having to fight back harder to maintain their jobs. This jeopardizes fairness because if there are artists that used AI to create their music are getting nominated over someone else’s original work, then anyone who did not use AI to assist in creating a song is working at a disadvantage. In the end, the artists who use AI will end up being nominated and making more money than other artists causing the industry to become smaller, and more AI driven."
1082,S0122,4,"I think the key challenges here for applying AI to your business would start with the price. If the cost of adding AI capabilities to your organization would cost more than it saves in the long run, obviously it would not be worth it until costs were brought down. Again, I mentioned the accuracy of information, if the AI is going to be placed in a critical position like dispensing medical prescriptions, it had better be using the correct information. I think the most important developments of AI for the business sector would be its legal developments. Whatever the government decides is legal for AI to be used for in business would be the first thing you have to consider when investing for the future in AI. But AI is still so new and the government probably does not have a good grasp of what AI is even capable of, so we will have to wait and see what kinds of rules and regulations Washington is going to spew out for AI."
1083,S0123,4,"Generative AI can be used as an innovative idea for achieving strategic benefits for an organization, but there are some key challenges that occur when doing so. “There are legal and ethical questions when it comes to training data” not only is this true, but generative AI models require large and high-quality datasets for training. This alone can be a significant challenge for innovative ideas because these ideas typically have scarce or unstructured data available. It goes without saying that generative AI should be used in conjunction with human judgment and expertise. With this comes another problem, developing and implementing generative AI solutions requires a team of experts. Organizations may have trouble attracting and retaining top talent with expertise in AI due to the high demand. As with any online tool there comes a problem with security and privacy. Generative AI is not safe from attacks so it is important to protect these systems from security threats to ensure the privacy of sensitive data. Everyone is skeptical of AI and its increasing popularity. Many accept it as an emerging technology but just as many reject it and find issues lying within the increased use of AI. It is important that organizations ensure that their employees, customers etc. trust and adopt AI in order to use it for achieving strategic benefits."

One other challenge would be data quality and quantity since generative AI relies on data to produce its results. Generative AI uses large amounts of data so there is a possibility of its output being inaccurate or unreliable due to the quality of the data. The cost to use generative AI for an innovative idea may be expensive as well, in order for a business to be successful with an innovative idea it needs to be scalable and catch the attention of many, the amount of data required for this is immense. "
1086,S0126,4,"The key challenges when applying AI to innovative ideas are data quality and quantity, ease of understanding, and the ethical concerns associated with AI. Data is always the first and most important aspect of an AI systems, without it the AI would not have anything to reference against. The overall amount of data is very important because many variations of a subject will provide a better overall data profile the AI can use. Additionally, the quality of data is also important because a clear and concise image of a subject without too much extra information makes it easier for the AI to find a pattern. The ease of understanding with AI is also very important because AI interpretations can seem questionable to many people because of the ambiguity involved with their decision making. This can be avoided by having someone in the company that can understand the AI output and can give an explanation of the data to a layperson. Last, and certainly the most important problem with AI, is the ethical issues. AI cannot make ethical decisions because they do not have human emotions and logic processes. AI can only ever be as ethical as its users, so the ethical concerns with AI shouldn't be addressed with lines of code, but by insuring that ethical users are the ones working with AI."
1087,S0127,4,"Some of the key challenges when applying generative AI is the amount of data needed to make a quality output. These models require a lot of data and if the organization doesn't have that much the quality will most likely be compromised, Also, the ethical reasons are going to be a main threat to an organization because they need to be super on top and responsible of these dilemmas. Lastly, organizations may also rely on this technology way too much.

1089,S0129,4,"There are some key challenges when applying generative AI to an innovative idea for achieving strategic benefits for an organization. One key challenge that arises is employee retention. This means how do we keep our employees and improve their work with generative AI. The goal of generative AI should not be to take over, but to aid in the process. Also we as the users have to be more open and available to the idea of generative AI. Many people see generative AI as a threat and are often scared to use it because they believe it's going to take over. We need to eliminate this stereotype and make it so that we can use this technology in a way to aid us. Another challenge that is presented when applying this technology is that not all of the technology is 100% accurate. Sometimes the generative AI does make mistakes and doesn’t really achieve what you are trying to get out of it. This can be a problem in an organization because many times there is small margin for error and we can’t have generative AI making mistakes.

1091,S0131,4,"I think the biggest challenge with applying generative AI to an organization is the initial
process of training it and doing the trial runs. It is crucial that you are setting the correct
and specific guidelines and inputs to achieve the results you are wanting. Another
difficult challenge in applying generative AI is the fact that the future can not be told and
so although it is able to adapt, if you program it for a certain thing and the whole
environment changes it will be difficult to continue on with your projected plan. I think
another challenge is more on the technical aspect of training the AI. Since generative AI
is still up and coming, it will take a lot of manpower as well as technology to be able to
train the program correctly and properly. I think there should be a heavy emphasis on
making sure the ground work is properly laid before trying to launch this fully into a
business. I don't know exactly how time consuming it is to establish this training and
make any tweaks necessary, however we shouldn't rush just because its a new and
alluring technology. Overall the biggest challenge will be the initial set up and data
gathering to prep the AI properly for use."
1092,S0132,4,"There are some key challenges to applying generative AI to an innovative idea for achieving strategic benefits for an organization. One challenge is that people may use generative AI as their first and last tool for creating or innovating something rather than using it in conjunction with their own ideas and other tools. This will make people get lazy and not really use their own mind’s to innovate something. Another challenge is that people seem to fear generative AI and what it can do. It looks like people believe that generative AI is a threat to their job and security. This may stop people from learning the new tool and prevent organizations from successfully adopting the tool. Another challenge for generative AI is that it can be used unethically. This may cause companies and workers to get into legal and copyright issues and dispute when they would not have if they had not been using generative artificial intelligence. Bias can also be a problem if the data is put in incorrectly or in a biased way. All in all, many people fear that generative AI can replace human workers, cause legal and ethical issues like copyright, and be the sole tool used in projects."

Some of these challenges include data quality, talent shortages, and change management. Regarding data quality, when it comes to AI the quality of the content can only be as good as the data that is fed to them. AI technology must be updated regularly to keep up. Talent shortages need to be addressed as there may not be enough professionals within the field of AI to keep up with the rapid integration of the technology in companies. Change management is a key challenge as users must be trained in their organizations in order to have a smooth and successful implementation of the technology.Screen Shot 2023-10-08 at 11.48.55 PM.png"
1094,S0134,4,"When evaluating the challenges to using generative AI in an organization developing an innovative idea, there are a few main issues – data quality & quantity, cost, and time. Depending on the type of innovation idea, there may not be enough information already fed into the AI source or it might be of low quality. If there is a data quality issue, the solution would be sourcing more AI computations which can be costly. The last issue is cost; gathering more quality data for AI to learn and generate images, text, etc. can be costly and time intensive. There is also continuous learning and maintaining of AI databases, so how will businesses continue to use AI in a way that financially benefits them? Another challenge when using AI with an innovative idea is privacy concerns. If we are giving AI data about a pre-production idea, that data could then be given to competitors.

Secondly, there's the issue of bias in AI, where these systems can unintentionally learn biases present in the data, which needs active mitigation. The technical complexity of generative AI can be daunting, requiring organizations to assess if their infrastructure can handle it. Integrating AI into existing workflows is tricky and may meet resistance from employees used to the old ways. Gaining support from stakeholders at all levels of the organization is vital but can be difficult due to resistance to change. Ethical considerations beyond bias are also something to consider, involving transparency and ensuring AI decisions align with ethical guidelines.

achieving strategic benefits to an organization, most notably data quality, addressing biases, and
managing potential job displacement. The quality of the data that the generative AI platform uses
to learn from is incredibly important. If the data is biased and has false information, the
generative AI platform will learn from that and continue to spread and build off of that biased
and false information. This has severe implications because it contributes to many debates and
creates widespread unreliability and instability. In addition, the more that generative AI grows,
the more job displacement there will be. There are ways to address this, and if employees are
retrained early on, that can significantly diminish the negative impact of job displacement by
automation and other technology. Despite all of the inherent challenges, generative AI is very
innovative, and when paired with other innovative technology, it has the potential of achieving
incredible benefits to an organization. If these challenges can be mitigated early on, generative
AI can be built off of quality information that is unbiased and accurate. Additionally,

AI-generated content can be exploited maliciously, necessitating robust security measures. Effective collaboration between humans and AI systems is a challenge. Integrating generative AI into existing workflows and ensuring seamless cooperation may require employee training and adaptation. Continuous learning and adaptation of AI models are essential, demanding ongoing updates and retraining. Measuring the return on investment (ROI) and assessing the value generated by generative AI initiatives can be intricate. Understanding how these initiatives contribute to organizational goals necessitates diligent tracking, evaluation, and a comprehensive grasp of their impact. Tackling these multifaceted challenges requires a comprehensive approach, including the development of robust data strategies, adherence to ethical guidelines, compliance with legal regulations, continuous monitoring, and an unwavering commitment to responsible AI deployment. Organizations must meticulously assess the feasibility of generative AI projects while evaluating their potential benefits in relation to these challenges."
1104,S0144,4,"To facilitate strategic operations within an organization, artificial intelligence lends benefits recognize patterns and learns adaptations to new information. It is given automation to design processes based on an algorithm, creating potential increased efficiency for individuals in the workplace. It automizes repetitive tasks, leading to benefits of labor reduction and access to further innovative pathways. It can benefit within catering educational materials to individualized lessons, streamlining health care practices, and enhancing customer service with increased speed of assistance and information processes.

1105,S0145,4,"There are many key challenges when applying generative AI to an innovative idea or strategic benefits for an organization. To start off with, like all good things too much of something is also a bad thing. AI can sometimes be used too much to the point where the product fails to be unique or have character, this makes information or products boring and unwanted. This challenge can also be taken to the next step where it also creates the issue where employees will be too used to using AI that they themselves will fail to create innovative ideas by themselves. This in itself creates problems due to a decrease in originality. Another issue is that AI is facing in organizations is similar to the issue before. AI doesn’t see things like normal people do. AI sees everything as data so sometimes it’s hard to tell AI if it’s right or work compared to the nature of the world. Many cases such as pictures with people appearing with multiple fingers appear common to AI but to any living person is weird and not natural. To build upon that AI can also see or think in a way that humans don’t so issues will naturally come when we have a special viewpoint on things and AI can't yet get to that point in order to perform."
1106,S0146,4,"There are quite a few challenges when applying generative AI to innovative ideas. For starters since generative AI works most efficiently when it consumes a vast amount of data, those data sets need to be of high quality and need to pertain to the company for training. What you feed into the AI is what the AI will learn from to create your desired information. That can take a lot of time and money for the generative AI to collect and create data for specific applications, especially if the industry that is being operated has scarce information to begin with. Another challenge is that generative AI can become biased. Since AI learns through training data, if there is information that unintentionally reinforces biases, the AI will pick up on it and produce results that can be unfavorable for the company. Another challenge for generative AI comes from ethical concerns. If the generative AI used discriminatory or biased data through its training, it will have potential to create harmful or biased content that can affect those involved. 

"
1107,S0147,4,"It is important to not only legally apply these models to your business, but it also has to be specific to your goals as a company. I think there will be many companies that invest heavily in these models but won't necessarily see the fruits of their labor. They will advance the overall progress towards smarter language models but will not prosper in the long run in their initial projects. This makes it very risky to endeavor into a business based solely on using generative AI. There will be what seems like a million of the same products on the market within the year, especially if it goes viral. We have seen this with AI picture generation and all the work MidJourney has done to advance the generative AI scene. It went viral and I used it originally. Soon after, people developed similar products and used real tools to falsely emulate an app that was a scam that got people to download it a bunch of times. It muddies the actual user base and leaves a section of people affected scared off of using the tools because it is too hard for them to tell what is real or fake anymore. This is largely a problem in small communities or organizations. The large corporations are a lot more reputable and do a really good job making useful or efficient tools because if they don’t their userbase will cause a ruckus until it is gone or fixed."
1108,S0148,4,"I believe that the main challenge of applying generative AI is the hill of actually training 
it. It's not practical to pick up a public-use pre-trained model like ChatGPT to use in your 
organization. In order to train the model, you'll need to give it a large database of information in 
order for it to act in an accurate way. This can take weeks if not months to do, and many 
businesses may not have all the information that this model would need readily available. It can 
also be a struggle to keep this model constantly running. That's very demanding of energy, and 
it's very demanding of hardware. Plus, the public is not very confident or trustworthy of AI, and 
adopting it as an integral part of your organization can distance some of your customer base. 
Stockholders and investors may back out until the AI proves it can make your business profit 
more than it does with humans. There's also the risk of this AI divulging secrets it shouldn't tell 
through workarounds. ChatGPT can be convinced to ignore its guidelines with enough fancy 
wording, so it's possible this can happen if customers have direct access to speaking with the 
generative AI. If you're a law firm or a hospital, this runs an intense legal risk that may not be 
worth taking. Doctor-patient and lawyer-client confidentiality are enforced strictly, and violations
result in severe repercussions. "
1109,S0149,4,"There are many challenges that are going to be faced when incorporating generative AI
into organizations. One of the main reasons is the cost of AI. Organizations have to put a
lot of money into the idea that AI is going to make their company more innovative. There
is a lot of risk that comes with that and not a lot of cushion. AI is still a new thing that
might not be for every organization. It is up to the organization to decide that for
themselves and in order to do that, it takes losing money. Another reason would be the
lack of knowledge of the actual AI system and the lack of knowledge of the people whohave to work with it. It is a process that might take a while to learn and companies have
to be comfortable enough to fail a little bit in order to seek a reward that might not come.
AI systems need to be accurate for any job it does. Companies need to take the time to
ensure it is reliable because it can do so many wrong things that can lead to detrimental
things. Not everyone has the time to incorporate AI."
1110,S0150,4,"The quality of the data gathered may be a key issue for organizations. The hardest problem
problem seems to be getting a crew to assimilate to a new culture that uses AI as a basis for an
innovative idea."
1111,S0151,4," As mentioned in question 3 and its screenshots, a key challenge to applying generative AI to
an innovative idea are the legal and ethical issues that might entail in using generative AI and its
contents. Organizations must consider what laws and regulations they might breach in using
certain content or the ethical concerns with what data is being used (is it ethical for them to
source their information from their users or did they have prior consent to using their data?).
Another key challenge that one user mentioned and also something we covered in class is that
the initial investment or use of AI can be high since high-quality data is needed, along with a
“good” amount of it, and the time (and money) to collect and curate that data can be increasingly
substantial over time. If the data used is of “low” quality, results can be inaccurate and the
information provided by generative AI can be misleading or misinterpreted which can sometimes
lead back around to ethical considerations (maybe a generative AI creates a report that
misrepresents a certain group within a population). Organizations must take pre-measured
actions, not after the implementation of AI, in order to avoid and mitigate these challenges."
1112,S0152,4,"When applying generative AI to an innovative idea there might be some challenges. One challenge could be all of the data used to train AI might not be enough to necessarily train or it might not be maintained well enough. This could cause some setbacks because it might not be as effective compared to AI which is trained with data that is well maintained. With the rigorous training AI must go through before it is launched, organizations need the right software and hardware to handle all of the information and to prevent any cyber-attacks. Although there is a lot of training that needs to be done before it can be launched, no one truly knows the outcome of how it will act and what it will say. It is a challenge trying to figure out what AI will generate and if the results will be trustworthy and reliable. Another big challenge is the fact that many people believe AI is going to replace humans in the workplace. Businesses must think of ways for AI and humans to collaborate in order to minimize the stress AI is creating. "
1113,S0153,4,"There are various challenges when it comes to applying generative AI to an innovative idea. First and foremost, the data collection and curation required are not small tasks. The company must invest in the resources necessary to compile a vast amount of data and prepare it to be processed in way that will yield a result. Even if the company can manage to compile this amount of data, the organization’s project leaders must be prepared to guide the outputs and make sure that the final product is in align with the initial goal and the overall endeavor of the organization. This all requires the use of a model that needs to be sources and compute power needs to be invested in the project. These means hardware or servers need to be purchased or leased to give the AI model the platform to perform the required tasks. If the company working on this project is in a sector with heavy regulation like finance or healthcare, ample resources need to be assigned to the compliance discussion. All aspects of the project need to fall within the legal right of the company to conduct the project and no laws can be broken in the pursuit of the desired outcome. "
1114,S0154,4,The key challenges are the legal and ethical challenges as well as the amount of time and money that an organization would have to put into generative AI. Like in the previous question an organization can run into a lot of challenges legally. For example copyright issues since generative AI goes through so much data you can never really be sure of each aspect of the generation and how the AI came up with it. Based on this you could think that generative AI is helping you come up with an innovative idea or solution but it may be something that was already thought of already trademarked. There is also a lot of money and time that would need to be invested in generative AI for it to have access to the amount of data it would need to create something really innovative and never thought of before. Organizations would need computers that are capable of handling a large amount of data. They would also need systems and algorithms that are compatible with generative AI to ensure. Depending on the size of the company this could be a big risk and investment or it could be something that works out perfectly for the organization.
1115,S0155,4,"One key challenge is the availability and quality of data. Generative Ai relies on large amounts of high-quality data. Although, organizations may struggle to gather the necessary data if the data needed is classified. Generative AI is smart and can be of great help but there needs to be enough data to have the greatest result. Another issue is ethical considerations and computational resources.  

 "
1116,S0156,4,"A key challenge to applying generative AI to achieve strategic benefits for an organization is the cost of implementation. As with any new technology or business processes, phasing out the old system, training employees to use the new system, and implementing the new system is very expensive. Careful change management is also required as people may resist implementation, especially as many associate AI with job losses. A company could also have a potential use for AI that would increase efficiency, but not have the right data available to successfully use AI. Several people in the discussion I used for this question commented that AI requires good quality data to work well and be trained correctly, which not all companies may have. This issue pertained particularly to using AI for supply chain management. Other potential problems with using AI in business from what I saw people comment about are alienating customers and over-reliance on AI. Some customers of a business may respond negatively if they learn that the company is using AI. They could feel that using AI is unethical because it displaces people, worry about data privacy, or simply dislike the idea. The temptation to rely blindly on AI because it is reputed to be very powerful is another pitfall for businesses. AI can create errors with far-reaching consequences if it is widely used in a business."
1117,S0157,4,"Implementing generative AI for strategic benefits comes with challenges. Data quality and bias are significant concerns, as the AI model's performance heavily relies on the quality and representativeness of the training data. Ensuring that the model does not perpetuate or amplify biases present in the data is crucial. Explainability (also referred to as “interpretability”) is the concept that a machine learning model and its output can be explained in a way that “makes sense” to a human being at an acceptable level. Explainability is a challenge, as the AI systems with internal workings that are invisible to the user make it difficult to understand and interpret the decision-making process, which can be a concern in regulated industries.

Ethical considerations surrounding the use of AI, particularly in decision-making processes, demand careful attention. Integrating generative AI into existing organizational processes and achieving widespread adoption can be complex and requires overcoming resistance to change. Security is also a challenge, with potential vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks or unauthorized access posing risks to sensitive data. Addressing these challenges is essential for organizations to harness the full potential of generative AI for strategic innovation.
"
1118,S0158,4,"Personally, I think these challenges will become much more frequent the longer we have generative AI. I believe this is due to similar questions constantly being asked as to how to improve certain products or what to do differently to make a product more successful. The AI will eventually spit out the same information to everyone trying to innovate a certain item or system. Once those products/systems are innovated as much as they can be, I believe we will be at a stand still until technology improves to allow us to get to the next step of what can be innovated. From user u/Thisisforhomeworkis3 mentioned how challenges like these are allowing us to get great data for training. This user doesn’t believe there are many key challenges as the people within the workplace will be able to solve and keep up with editing and tuning the AI they use for whatever action they’re wanting to perform. User u/ImagSuch5097 mentions how the initial start up process for setting up the AI will be the most challenging as the biases can get out of control and making sure the AI can follow certain guidelines and maintain an unbiased perspective.

1119,S0159,4,"There are several key challenges when considering the application of generative AI to an
innovative idea for achieving strategic benefits for an organization. But many of these issues
kind of point to a main central issue, is that there has never been AI oversight in many years past.
Because of this, companies are really struggling to grapple with AI as a concept, how to use it
responsibility, and what it even means to use AI in an effective and meaningful way. Ai is such a
vast industry capable of so many possibilities, and as such, there needs to be responsible leaderswithin AI that lead the innovative ways that AI contributes to organizational settings. Companies
must to more to understand the responsible use of AI and need leaders that work responsibilities
with a baseline of ethics and effective leadership to command these efforts."
1120,S0160,4,One of the biggest challenges that folks pointed out was that it simply just is too new to know. The technology is too knew to understand its full set of capabilities and in turn is too knew to understand the down falls as well. It is also difficult for organizations to find staff that understand the inns and outs of the whole system and not enough organizations what to spend money staffing a team that they do not comprehend the full scope of. There is a great deal of prior knowledge that goes into being able to utilize generative AI. One user mentioned that the Law Firm they work at won't even do direct deposit but instead makes everyone pick up their physical check on Fridays because the old owner does not what to adopt the new age technological way of doing things. There are many people like that out in the world who I think will get in the way for this adoption of AI technology or at least greatly slow it down.
1121,S0161,4,"While generative AI is starting to be the uproar in conversation and even businesses are adopting the concept. There are many challenges that can happen when trying to implement the technology. It can be very expensive to utilize it. Employees may not want to participate in the advancements of AI out of concern of it replacing their jobs. There are tons of information that will need to be uploaded into the AI. I am assuming that each generative AI will have to be trained in how each business operates. To understand the rules and how to provide the best support to the company without being biased. Not to mention that all these businesses are uploading very important and private information about the company and its customers. There will always be a concern that the system could fail and be hacked, and they could potentially be sued by customers. Again, once AI is introduced to the company there is the potential job loss. How much will the company have to invest to train new employees in what to do with these AI systems? I gather that much like having an IT department, that you will need to have a department that is strictly dedicated to making sure the system functions in according to the company’s standards. "

1123,S0163,4,"There are challenges that arise from applying generative AI to an innovative idea. One of these being that people rely on generative AI too much and don’t think for themselves. It is a lot easier to ask AI something and not think for ourselves. I think this is a big problem when it comes to innovation. I am not alone with this type of thinking. Other users agree with me with this idea. Another reddit user that is known as AILeariningAssignment points out that AI won’t conform to exactly what you are wanting them too. I understand from this person’s post that you can be as concise as you want when asking generative AI, a question and they may never be concise enough. It is kind of like when you try and google something and the exact answer you want doesn’t come up. They are saying that this could be the same way with generative AI. As I have already pointed out, we should not fully rely on AI. We can use it as a tool to help us, but it might not fully give us what we want. AI and technology are sometimes unreliable. I do think that humans still have an advantage over AI.

1124,S0164,4,"The legal and ethical aspects of AI are some of the biggest problems an organization may face. They may also face a lack of personalization with clients and people looking for answers or giving product feedback. This can affect sales and product or company reviews. Also, employees may encounter issues with this because they can be at a loss of a job because of the integration of AI. This form of AI, especially Chat GPT-3 is so innovative  and intelligent that it can almost completely replace human interaction with consumers.

1125,S0165,4,The largest key challenge in Generative Artificial Intelligence is creating the machine itself that generates your outcome. As Generative Artificial Intelligence needs a database and program to run in order to create your outcome it is hard to program every aspect of a human mind into a program that is supposed to act or think like a human. A hard part is to think of the aspects or little tasks we do that we don't even realize we do. As many programers in the Generative Artificial Intelligence create these programs but forget the little aspects you don't realize which play a big part in your outcome and without them you won't get the same result. So Generative Artificial Intelligence’s hardest challenge is actually programming a machine that is as powerful as a human. As it is still so new it is extremely difficult to find coders and people that make Generative Artificial Intelligence models. Once you have the Generative Artificial Intelligence it is also hard to keep giving it content as without content the Generative Artificial Intelligence model won't stay at the top of its game.

A large understanding is needed to allow for the fine-tuning of the model and to make sure everything is functioning properly. Ethics is also a major challenge those face when applying generative AI. Biases make results unintentionally due to the data being used, this is a major challenge.

The availability and quality of data are two major issues. To produce reliable results, generative AI significantly relies on vast amounts of high-quality data. Organizations may find it challenging to collect and curate the essential data, particularly if they work in sectors where data is in short supply or extremely sensitive. The complexity of generative AI algorithms is another difficulty. It frequently takes a lot of computer power and knowledge to build and optimize these methods. Data scientists and engineers who can effectively use generative AI to achieve strategic benefits must be available to organizations. Furthermore, stakeholders within an enterprise can be opposed to generative AI. Some people might have doubts about the technology or worry that they would lose their jobs as a result. Implementation success depends on addressing these issues and clearly articulating the advantages of generative AI."

Balancing automation with human oversight, especially for content generation, is another challenge, as is managing the substantial resource requirements, which can pose constraints for smaller organizations. Staying adaptable to the evolving field of generative AI and navigating the complex regulatory landscape adds to the list of challenges. Building user trust in AI-generated content, convincing stakeholders of its value, and ensuring scalability as organizations grow further underscore the strategic complexity.

words”. Now this is a simple statement but what I believe this shows is that generative AI does 
not have the human brain and human element which is important in innovation. An example I 
like to give is the Wright Brothers. If we created AI then and asked it to create an invention 
when nothing g like that existed it would not have anything to use to create an answer. A 
person can think outside of the box and generate ideas that may not seem possible, but they 
will make it possible like the Wright Brothers did. The generative AI systems now cannot think 
outside of their box and will create answers that are right and possible. An answer that is 
innovative may seem incorrect to them and that may mean they do not use it as an answer 
output. AI can help organizations do parts of tasks that will eventually build up to achieve 
innovative strategic benefits but they cannot come up with a super innovative idea if there is 
nothing about it out there in the first place.

1134,S0174,4,"An organization has its own set of difficulties when implementing generative AI for strategic advantages. Large and varied datasets are necessary for the efficient training of generative AI models. It may be quite difficult to ensure that data are both high-quality and plentiful while being bias-free. Biases existing in the training data can be inherited by generative AI models, thereby producing unfair or discriminating results. Fairness and prejudice mitigation are continuous challenges. Since many generative AI models function as ""black boxes,"" it might be difficult to understand how they make decisions. Explainability is essential, particularly in situations where choices have major effects. In order to ensure the ethical usage of generative AI, issues like user permission, privacy, and responsible AI deployment must be taken into consideration. Innovation and ethical issues must be navigated carefully. Strategic objectives may change due to the changing nature of the corporate world. Continual monitoring and updates are necessary for generative AI models since they must adapt and learn in order to continue functioning effectively. It might be challenging to incorporate generative AI into current organizational structures. The goal of ensuring seamless integration without interfering with existing procedures is frequently difficult.

1135,S0175,4,"Data privacy and security are going to be the constant challenge within AI. If you use a third party software, such as ChatGPT,  it is a risk to the company. However, it is extremely unfeasible for most companies to create their own AI software, especially with comparable effects as ChatGPT. 
Additionally, AI can be difficult to interpret. There can be hidden biases that are near impossible to see at first, such as the hiring issue. On top of that, AI can give many new ideas, but people would still need to tell which of those ideas are actually good or not and change the real-world results accordingly. 
Specifically with content generation, there is a lot of ethical and legal concerns with what organizations can do. Typically, copyright protects artists. AI can simulate artists’ work using their art as training material. This way, it wouldn't exactly be stealing from that artist, but it is essentially the same, and you do not have to pay much at all. However, this is extremely unethical. 
If anyone has ever worked at an organization, they would likely know software integration can be absurdly difficult. It takes a long time to roll out, a long time for the user base to learn the software, and oftentimes has unexpected struggles that the organization did not anticipate.

1141,S0181,4,"In my OKC research, it appears that are several different challenges that prevent organizations from gaining benefits from leveraging generative AI, largely centered around lack of adoption. The first is that 75% of businesses worldwide want to consider or outright ban generative AI at work. This number shocked me. I understand the fear that generative AI can output false information, but a majority of businesses being against the use of generative AI means most organizations will not reap strategic benefits from the emerging technology. Another challenge, as referenced in my answer to Question 2, is that workers are hiding their generative AI use from their employers, for fear of retaliation. Incorporating generative AI into a business could result in global employee productivity, however, that will always be dampened by the disconnect in communication between employee and employer if there is distrust between the groups. The advancement of leveraging generative AI stifled by a lack of transparency of employees afraid of punishment. Another challenge with that employees are under pressure with keeping up with generative AI. One post within my OKC showed the results of a survey that employees are feeling pressured, anxious, and fearful that their knowledge of generative AI is behind their coworkers’ and often misrepresent their true level of understanding the technology. Like my last point, a disconnect in the conversations between employees on generative AI may slow the adoption and use of the emerging technology. Lastly, I believe there is a generational gap in the adoption of generative AI use. There appears to be sources that point to the trend of younger generations being quicker on the adoption of generative AI than older generations. This gap in adoption could result in organizations not using the technology to the fullest."

However, by using AI, as stated above, the general public does not want to see art created by a computer program that could have been done by a human. When it comes down to AI, I generally believe it is going to be at its best in situations where text needs to be documented, or found, in the case of the law offices I mentioned above, and will be hated when utilized in creative forms of media.

I understand the argument is that the employee should always check or know that something is false, however, the purpose of generative AI in the business world is to reduce the need for running those reports yourself. Yes, the user will know if it is drastically different from what it should be, however, if it is a normal-looking graph and the only checks and balances are to run the regression or forecast it yourself, the AI component loses its benefit to the company.

Additionally, there is the issue of plagiarism and copyright laws that must be abided by. There is also the ethical problem of AI potentially replacing people in the workforce. Other than these issues, however, there are some other challenges that may come up.
Keeping company and employee information private is a challenge that may come up when implementing generative AI. As the AI is gathering information or coming up with new information, there is the risk of sensitive information being released. Another challenge that may arise is integration within the organization. Replacing already existing systems and integrating generative AI with existing workflows can be extremely challenging. It may be difficult to get the differing systems to coincide, and it also may be difficult for employees to get used to the new technology. Lastly, the implementation of AI is a very costly process, thus companies must be prepared to put a great deal of time, money, and resources into this process. While these challenges certainly may not be easy to overcome, the power of generative AI and the uses it has in organizations is certainly worth these challenges.

1147,S0187,4,"The application of generative AI to novel concepts for organizational strategic advantages presents several significant challenges. First and foremost, data quality and quantity are essential. For efficient training, generative AI models require large and high-quality datasets. For specialized or proprietary applications, obtaining and curating such data can be time-consuming and expensive. Second, it is crucial to consider ethical issues related to bias and fairness. By unintentionally reinforcing biases found in the training data, generative AI can produce discriminatory results. To guarantee fairness and equity in AI-generated content or decisions, organizations must put rigorous bias detection and mitigation strategies into place. Thirdly, transparency and interpretability may be hampered by the ""black box"" nature of some generative AI models. In regulated industries where explainability is crucial for compliance and trust, understanding how these models produce results is essential. In conclusion, issues with data quality, ethical considerations, model transparency, cybersecurity risks, and organizational adaptation arise when generative AI is used for innovation and strategic advantages. To fully realize the potential of generative AI for organizational success, it is essential to effectively address these issues.

1148,S0188,4,"Some of the key challenges that are posed when applying generative artificial intelligence
to an innovative idea for achieving any benefits are property rights, possible liabilities,
and even any type of privacy issues. Property rights and possible liabilities are two of the
biggest issues that can arise from applying this type of technology to an innovative idea.
Even though you want to achieve benefits for an organization, either financially or
socially, property rights and possible liabilities could cause a bit of issues. First off, this
type of artificial intelligence will make it quite difficult to pinpoint the creation of the
idea. It is going to make you question whether or not the idea was original or simply a
plain suggestion. On a legal standpoint, artificial intelligence could make the idea prone
to illegal circumstances. The idea could have no rightful ownership or simply plagiarize
off of some other idea down to the last detail. Privacy issues could also pose a challenge
when it comes to the creation and development of the innovative idea. By using
generative artificial intelligence, the technology could outline the plan of the idea to other
people. Other people and innovators could take that and use it for their own account."
1149,S0189,4,"Looking at questions asked in the community, according to members applying generative AI, the main challenge that most of them face is knowing how to use it. This is a small gate to entry but one that has been brought up in many posts asking exactly how to get into AI. On many posts talking about the uses for generative AI and ideas for how to improve business strategy using it, there will be many replies asking something along the lines of, “Yes, but how do I use it?” This shows that companies should invest in hiring people who are knowledgeable about AI to train current employees if the current employees are unknowledgeable. Another issue comes with knowing what to do with the generations that the AI has created. AI can interpret, show, and create many pieces of data, but organizations still have to know how to apply the information. Over-reliance on AI can be a serious issue in this sense. Asking the generative AI to do everything in executing a business strategy is not feasible. It takes the human using it to be able to know what to do with the information received from the AI and how to get the most out of it."
1150,S0190,4,"Just like everything else in this world, there are a lot of challenges when applying generative AI to an innovative idea for achieving strategic benefits for an organization. Key challenges that could be worked through but still challenges that need to be overcome. Number one key challenge in my opinion is the data requirements that generative artificial intelligence requires to to successfully produce the accurate outcome. Generative AI models require large amounts of data to learn and generate high-quality outputs. This is an issue because some organization might not have a large enough data and quality data required to have the outcome needed. The second challenge organization face is one that we talked about already, ethical issues. There are a lot of ethical concerns associated with the use of generative AI as we have discussed, such as the potential for the technology to be used to create biased and false information, as well as copyright and intellectual property issues and data privacy violations that could be caused. There are also issues that can arise since the data that is collected could be not aligned with the organization's strategic goals and plans. All in all, I think the challenges that organizations will face is problems that could be solved. 

 "
1151,S0191,4,"There are also key challenges to this as to obtain reliable results, generative AI largely relies on enormous amounts of high-quality data. Organizations may find it difficult to collect and curate the appropriate data, particularly if they operate in industries where data is scarce or highly sensitive. "
1152,S0192,4," of the main challenges is ensuring the quality of content for the inputs. The start-up and maintenance costs of creating accurate AI can be quite costly. The computer power required to keep it running can be quite significant, especially as it becomes more complex and thorough. There was an entire thread about how Chat GPT spends $700,00 per day to keep it updated and running. For many organizations (depending on the size and field) the benefits of using generative AI would not outweigh the costs. 
AI is limited by the information that it is given. This means organizations would need to put massive amounts of data into the system in order to be more thoroughly effective. Not only that, but the data also needs to be updated regularly in this rapidly changing world or it will quickly become obsolete or inaccurate. For example, if you were to ask AI how much an NFL ticket to the Chiefs game costs, the correct answer would be very different today than it was a month ago before Taylor Swift started dating Travis Kelce. 
Another important factor to consider is bias. If the programmer is biased or uses skewed information to enter into the system, the AI doesn’t know any better. It assumes what it is told is correct. So, when it is asked to generate content, it can do so in a very convincing way that may not reflect reality, or what the user intended.
"
1153,S0193,4," There are a few challenges organizations must face if they want to use generative AI for
their benefit. Firstly, AI requires a large amount of data availability. If a company does
not have the quality of data or space for the AI to work properly, then it will not be able
to use it for its intended purpose. Organizations also need to be sure that the data they
make available for the generative AI to use is safe and filtered. No company wants to
open itself up to a scandal because their AI is leaking private information.
Another challenge with using AI is steering it in the right direction. Organizations need to
be very specific to reach the full potential of this technology. They will need to have
employees on their team that are experienced with AI. For the current time, this will
probably be difficult to achieve. Artificial Intelligence is an extremely new technology;
there are few people out there who have enough experience with it. Organizations will
have to find people with this knowledge and probably pay a large amount to keep them.
The common denominator here is money. For an individual, the costs of using generative
AI are nominal. However, large corporations have to take on a lot more responsibility if
they want to make AI a part of their innovation process. Any organization that wants to
use AI must have enough funds to make it possible."
1154,S0194,4,"One of the biggest challenges is integrating generative AI into existing workflows and
ensuring user adoption can be a challenge. It may require changes in processes and
training for employees. Another challenge is mostly data wise. The kind of data needed
to train the model, where the data is gotten from/sourced. Lastly, key challenges include
ensuring data quality for training, addressing biases in AI outputs, and managing
potential job displacement due to automation. Striking a balance between automation
and human involvement is crucial for successful implementation."
1155,S0195,4,"The key challenges when applying generative AI to an innovative idea for achieving strategic benefits for an organization is when it comes to creativity. While AI can perform certain tasks efficiently, it can do things in a very quick way and you don't have to pay it a wage it still lacks factors in the thinking and creativity factors. It is not capable of the creative thinking that a human has or even our problem solving skills. This in turn makes a product that may not have actual people in mind and even many errors thus needing to be reviewed constantly and not to be completely trusted at least in these early stages of AI. Another key challenge is how using AI may not be a very transparent way to do many things and how it may not be able to take accountability for things like privacy issues and sustainability or even bias when creating innovative ideas. Another key challenge is how when applying generative AI to an innovative idea that it may produce language repetitions that generate overused word patterns thus limiting collective intelligence and not producing the innovative ideas that many companies may want. These are some key challenges that can appear when applying generative AI to an innovative idea for achieving strategic benefits for an organization. "
1156,S0196,4,"Some of the key challenges when trying to apply AI to an innovative idea in a business
setting include the relevancy and accuracy of data, data privacy concerns and human-AIinteraction. It is hard to distinguish if the information the AI is presenting is 100% accurate and
relevant for what you’re looking for. This can affect gaining a strategic benefit, because you
might be presenting the wrong information to important stakeholders. It can also give off the
image that you're not qualified to discuss certain topics, because you’re using a faulty system as
your main source of information. Privacy concerns will always be an issue when using a system
that is entirely online. For example, the recent hacking of MGM has proved that nobody's
information is really safe. Lots of people reported their accounts being hacked and their personal
information being used to access their bank accounts. Finally, the challenge of introducing the AI
system causes fear of job replacement. There needs to be a balance between the use of an AI
system and human employees. Otherwise, it can be rejected by the employees and the company
will stay stagnant in terms of its technological advancement. Addressing these challenges will
require constant monitoring of the system and proper implementation within the company."
1157,S0197,4,"Key challenges when applying Generative AI to an innovative idea is availability and quality of data. Generative AI relies heavily on large amounts of high quality data to achieve accurate results.

Programming it your invocation may be challenging and it meets your innovative expectations. It all depends on your expectations you have, it potentially could have no challenges it just depends on your organization and what you are expecting.

"
1161,S0201,4,"When applying generative AI to an innovative idea, some of today’s challenges involve security, privacy, technological knowledge, and cost effectiveness. Depending on the product and the goals of an organization, implementing an AI may be costly and challenging. First off, these companies must have people employed that know how to use AI, as well as be able to take full advantage of the technology for the purpose of the business. This can be costly. They then have to be able to put the money into technology and new applications, programs, etc. While this can lead to a bigger profit in the long run, the company must make the decision of whether or not to make this investment. In addition, privacy and security can be a problem, if this is a product that involves customer information. Many people around the world are concerned about privacy when it comes to AI, and if a company chooses to utilize AI, they may be subject to a loss in profits. We must also remember that AI is essentially a robot. Data must constantly be entered in order to make these AI programs as up to date and accurate as possible. AI is only as helpful as it is maintained. There is also recent research that claims AI has a bias to it, which is also another challenge organizations face when implementing AI into their companies. 

"
1162,S0202,4,"Organizations need to remember that generative AI is to be used as a tool, most of all. One great point is that a company at risk of potentially facing legal implications must know that a machine cannot take legal responsibility, only a real human being can. Legal issues and disagreements may arise when determining ownership and intellectual property rights for content produced by AI. Using AI to create content might present privacy and ethical issues, particularly when it contains sensitive or private information. While using generative AI, organizations must traverse the legal and ethical frameworks. Organizations also have to remember that the use of AI must align with their long term goals and morals as generative AI models may need regular upkeep, retraining, and upgrades. A constant problem is ensuring their long-term viability.Screen Shot 2023-10-08 at 7.15.44 PM.png"
1163,S0203,4,"There are several key challenges when attempting to achieve benefits for an organization
using generative AI, including understanding security, ethics, trust, and potential bias within the
generative AI tools. Among the most important of these is security, which may become harder to
protect. For example, using artificial intelligence to help solve problems within your organization
requires the generative AI tool to have access to your data. This can become problematic if the
data were to be stored in a database owned by a company such as OpenAI or Microsoft, and then
that company’s security was compromised at a later date. While Microsoft generally has the trust
of society and is assumed to have a very secure data system, the power of Microsoft creates a
lucrative opportunity for hackers to attempt to extract sensitive information. Another key
challenge is attempting to maintain the trust of consumers in your product or service when using
generative AI. The use of generative AI has made it easier for companies to automate customer
service, falsify a large number of reviews, and obtain information about the customer at a much
faster rate. This may cause the loss in trust from consumers across all of society. People will
believe reviews containing only text at a lesser rate under the belief that the reviews may be
falsified. This can be combated with websites such as Amazon presenting a “verified purchaser”
tag next to the review, or a review containing video content to best demonstrate the product or
service. Consumer trust is essential to long term business success, and the widespread adoption
of generative AI may shift companies priorities in maintaining trust."
1164,S0204,4,"There are many key challenges when applying generative AI to an innovative idea for
achieving strategic benefits for an organization. One of the key challenges is data quality
and accessibility. Although generative AI collects a lot of data, it is not positive it has
data on the organization’s innovative idea. It can be hard for AI to give you the answer
you are looking for if it is unfamiliar with the idea or organization. Therefore, obtaining
the relevant information can be a hassle for organizations. Also, there is a possibility
there will be bias in content created by AI. This could result in the distribution of
deceiving and false information. If organizations release AI-generated information
without verifying its validity, this could become a huge issue and put organizations in a
legal conflict. The AI model needs training to ensure it produces accurate information
from valid sources to prevent incidents like this from occurring. Lastly, employees need
training on how to use generative AI. AI is a very complex system to understand.
Employees would need to be trained by experts who truly understand the system and its
functions. The organization should consider if employees are willing to learn this new
system and if they are okay with the changes. Some employees may feel hesitant aboutgenerative AI because they fear it will replace their jobs. As you can see, many
challenges are present when applying generative AI that organizations must consider
before deciding to implement it."
1165,S0205,4,"Organizations that will utilize generative AI to achieve strategic benefits will face some challenges. Ethical concerns, as previously discussed, arise. With generative AI, a company or organization must be aware that the content produced is appropriate and will not be used for harmful reasons. Another challenge an organization may encounter is user-friendliness. The generative AI tool must be compatible with the kind of user that will be using it. In the case where the generative AI model is not used because of difficulty, users will have a negative user experience, which harms the organization. Cost is a significant challenge when applying generative AI to ideas. The development and maintenance of these sophisticated models can be extremely costly. Companies and organizations will have to make decisions on whether or not the costs are worth the benefits the models provide. Because of these costs, smaller companies may be at a greater disadvantage. Since those organizations with the ability to invest in such technology will gain a competitive advantage, smaller organizations will face challenges in providing efficiency at lower costs. Moreover, the training that it takes for an AI model to work efficiently and effectively is noteworthy. Organizations face the challenge of navigating the many elements needed to review data and ensure it is correct and unbiased. 

 
"
1166,S0206,4,"One of the most difficult challenges when applying generative AI is that amount of data that it
would need for a specific purpose. The vast amount of data that it needs will allow it to run
efficiently without running into problems that require human intervention. If humans have to
keep doing maintenance and improvements, there is really no point to the AI if it cannot learn
from the mistakes or past data that it has seen already. There is also the ethical challenge that we
as humans must get over if we want to start applying generative AI to the masses. There is
already distaste for AI as it is assumed that it will take many jobs leading to a big separation in
social classes. Solving this problem will take massive amounts of public satisfaction in AI to
gain the trust of society before going 100% into it. One of the hardest challenges to overcome is
the development of AI in the first place. The creation and development of the AI can be severely
time consuming and expensive to build. Getting the right funding and people to work on AI can
be a challenge within itself. Overall, there are many challenges to overcome if AI is to be
successful within an organization."
1167,S0207,4,"There are too many challenges when trying to apply generative AI to an innovation, or anything
really, for me to cover all the key ones wihtin the scope of this assignment. The overall quality of
your data in terms of: quantity, quality, accuracy, age, etc. is of the firstmost importance when
trying to apply AI to achieve benefits for an organization. Simply if your data being used for a
generative AI model isn’t quality to begin with, or if it contains any unintentional biases within
the training data, you’ll likely just get useless results from your application. High-quality
datasets will be required to effectively train you AI model to get you the results you want.
Secondly, the task of gaining an understanding of how to use generative AI, and how to push that
understanding to your organizational staff is substantial challenge. Just trying to integrate your
generative AI system into existing systems and trying to push this adoption to your
organizational users is a challenge which typically takes a lot of training and financial resources
in order to make the adoption successful. In order to get the most from your generative AI, its
understand how your AI model will generate its responses and content."
1168,S0208,4,"A huge challenge is the availability and the quality of data in a certain field for the AI to look through and utilize. Often times, with more niche areas of industry of organizations there comes the issue of limitations in data and how this data can be used in a way that is understandable and useful for the task at hand. Especially if the company is in an area where data is highly sensitive or scarce enough for the need for companies to build their own data acquisition for use. This can be seen in many tech companies that often don’t have readily available quality information on their products of uses of newer tech, which is why data collection is so important to these companies to gather on their customer base. Another challenge is catering these AI to be useful to the certain field that you are trying to tailor it to. You have to develop an AI that is responsive to your specific field, whether you’re in the accounting field or the tech field, it has to be built to understand and process the different information it is being fed. This takes a lot of cost and man power for something that may not be guaranteed and work the way that companies need to cover the cost of developing such a system of technology for their uses. This is usually only available to more affluent companies that are able to fund these types of systems and developments in technology."
1169,S0209,4,"The problem with applying AI to something innovative is the lack of knowledge and experience AI has been in that innovated field. If it’s something truly innovative having AI doing something that no one has ever programmed, it to do will obviously be a challenge if you are lacking extreme coding and problem solving. Exploring anything and implementing a creative idea in any field is something that people have extreme challenges with, and unfortunately throwing an AI with no experience into the frenzy will not fix the issues or lack of infrastructure that any major innovation might have. Having the AI figure, it out is a challenge but not impossible, with generative AI it might take time to make the perfect companion to help you with your new inspiring idea whether it’s a mobile app or a physical project. Although the AI will be able to help with the management and oversight of a specific project, doing it might be a whole different story. How easy can AI be implemented in the future? Probably a lot easier than now but we will have to wait and see what Generative AI can do."
1170,S0210,4,"There are several challenges when applying generative AI to any innovative ideas for achieving organizational benefits. Generative AI relies heavily on substantial amounts of high-quality data output to achieve accurate results. Organizations may struggle to gather and curate the necessary data, especially if they do not have access to sufficient data or have data that is not a format that is compatible with generative AI models. The development. And deployment model requires specialized hardware, longer time, and different deployment architectures. It can also be complex and expensive. It is difficult to understand how generative AI works with Interpretability because it focuses on understanding the inner workings of the models. In this model it is transparent, and it provides information about the relationship between inputs and outputs. While explainability focuses on a clear and intuitive explanation of the decisions made, enabling users to understand why the model produces a particular result. Despite the challenges there is a growing interest in using generative AI to achieve strategic benefits for Organization. It can revolutionize the way that organizations develop new products and services, improve their operational efficiency, and make better decisions. Having a clear understanding of your goal and objective can be a terrific way to overcome the challenges of applying generative AI to innovative ideas.  "
1171,S0211,4,"Implementing generative AI for strategic benefits can be complex. Some of the key challenges include data quality and quantity, model training and fine-tuning, and the need for skilled AI professionals. The discussions in our group emphasized the importance of understanding these challenges to effectively harness the power of generative AI."
1172,S0212,4,"The thing required for generative AI to be a tool used successfully by an organization would be data. However, that data should be relevant to that organization for the tool to help the most. Think “The right tool for the job”. For the tool to help the most, it needs to be used properly. In this case, the generative AI needs quality data, and a lot of it. The modern generative AI models need large high-quality data sets to be able to produce relevant content -- similarly to how a new employee needs significant training to be able to do a good job. Thus, it can take a large amount of money and time investment to get the AI to the level of increasing profit margins.
	Another issue discovered by some organizations and individuals using generative AI is bias. Due to real discrimination being a part of humanity, it does learn to discriminate in art and literature. Organizations must spend time dedicated to detecting bias and teaching the AI not to discriminate. 
	The final issue discussed in my research was the transparency of generative AI. For some organizations, data is highly important – especially personal confidential data. Cybersecurity risks always exist and especially exist in generative AI. Some users may not want their data used for these AI as well, making a organization have to explain and be highly transparent in their data usage and process of generative AI. 

"
1173,S0213,4,"A huge hurdle to using AI is trying to use it with old systems. The old way of doing things sometimes can’t be compatible with AI technology. As such, new systems and software must be developed to incorporate generative AI for the firm to use. The cost to make these adjustments with AI can be more than the firm bargains for. It could force a firm to not use generative AI or find a cheaper alternative. A simple challenge is quality. The AI might be limited to outdated data or pushing out too much of the same. You need to set better parameters and use more updated data with metrics you need. Not having staff that are trained in using/implementing the AI can make it impossible to gain benefits from this technology. Make sure staff are aware of how to use the generative AI in their jobs. You also must either train or hire educated staff who know how AI works and develop the systems to make the art. 
As stated in question 3, you can run into legal and ethical issues. The AI generation must be monitored and reviewed for copyright infringement and malicious intent. The last one is how AI can be too complicated or vague. The work generated must be understandable and flow into the systems that exist today. The art must comply with company policies and procedures. The customer must also be able to understand the message of a video or metric too. Again, setting parameters can help reduce flaws and reach organizations goals.
"
1174,S0214,4,"•	Applying generative AI to achieve strategic benefits for an organization can have some challenges. Some of these challenges may be job transformation, legal and ethical issues, and biases. While job transformation can be something that is looked at as positive, if not done delicately, it could turn out to have a negative affect on an organization. For example, job transformation could be an AI tool assisting with customer service. Unfortunately, there are times when the customer wants to talk to an actual human rather than AI which may potentially cause a decrease in customers for that organization. Legal and ethical issues are pretty significant when it comes to challenges for AI integration because there are a lot of sub-categories that fall under this area. For example, cyber-attacks and fraud issues, misinformation, and copyright issues (as we reviewed on question 3).  Misinformation could cause customers to have trust issues with the organization if they keep getting fed false or fake information. Additionally, not following copyright guidelines could potentially cause legal issues for the organization. Biases or discrimination is a crucial key challenge because not promoting fairness and inclusivity while using generative AI will not only cause legal issues, but it could also impact multiple lives. Generative AI systems have the potential to influence decision-making processes and choices. These biases could lead unfair treatment, stereotypes, and systematic inequalities (Kaggle.com). By addressing these key challenges, generative AI could offer a more equitable and inclusive AI system.

1175,S0215,4,"When you apply generative AI to an innovation just like a video game, you may be rejected just like “potterharry97” was, he used generative AI artwork and was denied due to copyrighted material. This is not the only discussion post that I have read throughout reddit, which makes me concerned as any company would be for copyrighted material in all games which would make a company not want to use generative AI. If a company wanted to use generative AI artwork, songs, ideas, etc. they would need to almost triple check that there is no copyrighted material in any aspect of there games, products, or etc. because if there were they would lose a lot of money and would most likely not want to use generative AI after that. But because a company would need others to make sure there is no copyrighted material used, they would need to hire more staff or have the staff they have trained more in that area. Which would cause a rise in cost within the company’s salaries and upkeep for the generative AI with every new update with that as well. This is only one key challenge, there are so many more out there that can affect the company so I think that yes many companies want to use generative AI, but how long will it take them to fully trust that they would not be copyrighted.

Sometimes AI can also run into bumps in the road and can cause something that was working perfectly fine to not work like it used to anymore. Some employees may also need retraining on some things. Some other key challenges might include finding a balance between automation and human involvement. It may seem like every task that is assigned AI can do it all, however, we have to remember that AI is a tool used to help us, not take over. Generative AI is used as a guide and a resource while humans are here in the event that AI cannot answer someone's question or if the machine malfunctions.

1178,S0218,4,"There is a variety of key challenges a company or organization may face when applying generative AI to an innovative idea for strategic benefits. When applying generative AI to strategic planning it takes away the work and creative ideas from workers. It gives people easier access to information without them having to do much strategic thinking or planning to develop an idea themselves. When generative artificial intelligence does the research and creates the content and ideas for the company it makes the company and individuals less knowledgeable on their product and research. Once an organization uses generative artificial intelligence to create its ideas, content, and products it will be fully reliant on artificial intelligence as it will continue to build its ideas as it becomes less knowledgeable about its own organization. Another challenge an organization may face when applying generative artificial intelligence to an innovative idea for strategic benefits is the information the artificial intelligence receives and where it may receive it. A company may be so reliant on the information they get from AI and use an idea that isn't theirs and this may result in a problem with copyright infringement. Businesses must be careful when using generative AI."
1179,S0219,4,"The key challenges include ensuring data quality for training, addressing biases in AI outputs, and managing potential job displacement due to automation. Generative AI models often require large and high-quality datasets for training. Acquiring and maintaining such datasets can be challenging, especially in specialized or niche domains. The second key challenge for generative AI is biases in output. AI models can inherit biases from their training data, which can result in biased or unfair output. Addressing and mitigating these biases is a critical challenge, especially when the generated content may impact decision-making. Job displacement is another key challenge. AI can take over certain tasks and employees who were previously responsible for those tasks may find themselves with skills that are no longer in demand. This can lead to a skills mismatch and job displacement unless they can be reskilled for new roles. Job displacement on a large scale can have economic consequences. In regions or industries heavily impacted by automation, there may be a need for economic policies and safety nets to support affected workers. The displacement of human workers by AI raises questions about fairness, economic inequality, and societal impact. Organizations need to consider these implications when implementing AI-driven automation."
1180,S0220,4,"a.	The key challenges when applying generative AI to an innovative idea for achieving strategic benefits for an organization are privacy and accuracy. When creating innovative ideas, it is important to gather accurate research and information. Therefore, the accuracy of generative AI can be a huge challenge when applying it to an innovative idea. This could cause problems in presentation or accurate evidence. Privacy is also a concern relating to innovative ideas. This is because if the information gets into the hands of the wrong people, it could lead to the user being taken advantage of. Their idea could be stolen or their information could be sold. Users might have no idea that this is happening and could get in the way of plans and goals. It could also be disruptive to an already existing system. This could cause the business to lose money and time depending on the effectiveness of the system. The use of generative AI could also cause ethical considerations. This is because of how much power the technology has and how it can be used. Generative AI could also cause issues of bias and fairness in the workplace. It is important to ensure that generated information is fair and ethical. Although there are key challenges in generative AI, there are many more benefits than disadvantages."

applying generative AI to an innovative idea for achieving strategic benefits for an organization
which include Data requirements, Model development and deployment, Model interpretability
and explainability, and Ethical concerns. When it comes to data requirements Generative AI is
operated by mass amounts of data to learn and generate it for the public. Companies can have a
hard time accessing the data if they have limited access to information or data unsuitable with
generative AI designs. The process of modeling and releasing the generative AI models can be
extremely difficult and vastly expensive to develop. Understanding the functions of how
generative AI works and explaining how they are able to generate vast amounts of information.
This can cause users and customers challenges in trusting generative AI. To ensure users' trust
informing them of how AI is used and the benefits it supplies can enhance their decisions. When
developing a new product companies must ensure that the Generative AI model's goals align
with the company's strategic goals, validate accurate data, and interrogate the AI model into the
workforce. Taking a strategic approach, establishing straightforward goals, and proper
investment in resources can ensure organizations overcome difficult challenges and succeed in
the generative AI market."
1182,S0222,4,"	Although generative AI can provide headache relief for organizations revamping efficiency and innovation, generative AI can have adversities because effectively utilizing generative AI necessitates the presence of large data information for reliability occurrences. For instance, organizations that have restrictions with sufficient data for reliability purposes, and utilize improper format data can consequently impact organizations to experience efficiency slipping away. On the other hand, generative AI can provide adversities for organizations with innovation desires since generative AI can be impractical for organizations that advocate for limited budgets and have unknowledgeable resources that cannot fully utilize the generative AI for organizational purposes. For instance, an inception business would find generative AI impractical because an inception business would prioritize staying afloat for revenue and limiting debt purposes, rather than be arrogant to implement generative AI since generative AI may cause an inception business to experience an undesired deep hole. Also, generative AI can have adversities when its interpretability starts to perturb organizations that have lackluster knowledge on how output occurrences can aid for efficiency purposes. For instance, if organizational members cannot assuredly utilize the capabilities of generative AI without guidance, then adversity occurs for implementing generative AI as organizational members would hesitate to put faith into generative AI that makes them perturb, and discourages the organization to make strides for innovation purposes. "
1183,S0223,4,"When applying generative AI to an innovative idea for achieving strategic benefits for an organization, a couple key challenges will arise. Some of those challenges include data quality, costs, and unintentional bias. First, it is important that generative AI is capable of retrieving quality data to give its user a quality response. Generative data should be programmed/created to work with the best sources it can retrieve without crossing the line of using data it is not allowed to (the private/confidential data mentioned in the response to question 3). It’s difficult for an organization to create an AI system that will use quality data, related to the organization’s goal, to end with a beneficial outcome. Second, it is not cheap to apply generative AI that will lead an organization to benefits. An organization would need to invest a lot of money to have a good AI system that will not fail. Maintaining the AI system while it is in use will also cost organizations. Third, AI has faced problems related to bias information (also mentioned in the response to question 3). It’s difficult for an organization to have an AI system that doesn’t contain a little bias. When AI goes through data, it might be limited to that data, and its response would be based on the limited data it goes through."
1184,S0224,4,"Applying generative AI to innovative ideas for achieving strategic benefits in an organization can be highly promising, but it also presents several key challenges that must be navigated effectively: Generative AI models require extensive and high-quality training data. Organizations may struggle to collect and curate such datasets, leading to potential biases and inaccuracies in generated content. Generative AI can perpetuate biases present in training data, resulting in biased content or recommendations. Ensuring fairness in AI-generated outcomes is a critical challenge. Using AI to generate content or make decisions requires careful ethical scrutiny. The potential for misuse, such as creating deepfakes or spreading misinformation, must be addressed. Understanding how generative AI arrives at specific recommendations or content can be complex. Achieving transparency in AI decision-making processes is a challenge, especially with complex models like deep learning. While personalization is a benefit, it can also lead to filter bubbles and echo chambers, limiting diversity in content and perspectives. Balancing customization with diversity is a challenge. Determining the ownership of AI-generated content and potential copyright issues can be legally complex. Storing and processing large datasets for generative AI applications can pose privacy and security risks if not handled correctly. Developing and maintaining generative AI models can be resource-intensive, requiring skilled AI experts, computational power, and ongoing investments. Convincing users to trust and adopt AI-generated content or recommendations can be a hurdle, particularly in industries with conservative practices. Organizations must navigate the complex landscape of AI regulations and ensure compliance, which can be challenging as regulations evolve. Effective implementation of generative AI often requires collaboration between data scientists, domain experts, legal teams, and ethicists, which can be logistically challenging. Establishing mechanisms for ongoing monitoring, accountability, and addressing issues arising from AI-generated content or decisions is vital but can be complex to manage."
1185,S0225,4,"I think the biggest challenge would be bias. When the AI kind of picks up things from a
certain book for example. It would simply keep its knowledge in that alone rather than
looking at other opinions. This can lead to big problems because then it could be biased
towards a certain topic or culture. They pick up the information from similar data and it
would just enhance or be more detailed rather than look through different possibilities."
1186,S0226,4,"We kind of touched on this when talking about the legality of Generative AI and its
access to data and more can be said about this when it comes to challenges for
organizations. Some limitations and challenges can be copyrights and intellectual theft
through AI so Organizations are going to want to take their time and double check that
this awesome idea they got from AI wasn’t pulled from somewhere else. Another
challenge we have is that even though AI is really smart at This redditor had a good
point. It really takes human judgment out of the equations. So while An organization
might rely on AI for complicated solutions it isn’t full proof. The post used a really good
example. Even though we have AI cars that are self driving their drawbacks come when
there is traffic or heavy weather conditions since it takes those human judgements out.
This can be similarly said about Generative AI too. Looking further down the comments
this one redditor also made a great point. When it comes to AI creating art work it takes
that human aspect out of it. Since emotions are involved in music and art work. This can
be a limitation since AI doesn’t have feelings like us and most great art work or music
come from a place where an artist is vulnerable and passionate."
1187,S0227,4,": Some key challenges that you might experience when applying generative AI is that there is no guarantee the predictions that the program will spit out are correct. The information that these models take in and use to form their analysis may be inaccurate or biases and cause the predictions to be inaccurate and biased as well. If these erroneous predictions were to happen, there is also a big chance that you wont know if this happens. This spreading of misinformation, even if unknowingly, cannot be beneficial for an organization. 

"
1188,S0228,4,"When applying generative AI to an innovative idea for achieving strategic benefits for an 
organization, several key challenges must be addressed to ensure successful implementation. 
These challenges can vary depending on the specific use case and industry. Successfully 
addressing that involves cross-functional collaboration, continuous learning, and a commitment 
to ethical and responsible AI practices. Organizations should also be prepared to adapt their strategies as technology and regulatory landscapes evolve. Some common uses to consider 
include: 
Data Quality and Quantity: Generative AI models often require large, high-quality datasets for 
training. Acquiring and curating such data can be challenging, especially for niche or emerging 
domains. Organizations may need to invest in data collection, data augmentation, and data 
cleansing to ensure availability of suitable training data.  
Model Complexity and Resources: Training generative AI models can be computationally 
intensive and resource demanding. Smaller organizations may face limitations in terms of 
hardware and expertise. Considering cloud-based services, pre-trained models, or collaborations 
with AI research organizations to access resources and expertise. 
Ethical and Legal Concerns: Addressing ethical and legal issues, such as bias and privacy, and 
copyright infringement, is important when generating content using AI. Developing ethical 
guidelines, incorporating fairness measures, and being updated on relevant laws and regulations.  
User Acceptance and Trust: Users may be skeptical of AI-generated or interactions. Building 
trust in AI systems is essential. Clearly communicating when AI is being used, ensuring 
transparency, and providing mechanisms for users to verify or correct AI-generated content.  
 
 
 
 "
1189,S0229,4,"I concluded when applying generative AI to an innovative idea for achieving strategic benefits for an organization, four challenges it will face are data quality and quantity, moderating the system, cost of maintenance, and users accepting this. Generative AI models often require large amounts of data to produce meaningful results, a challenge for organizations dealing with proprietary or sensitive information. Organizations must build a cyber force to protect private or valuable information. If they fail to do so, lawsuits will happen. Based on the past Reddit posts I have seen, Organizations will need to moderate the system to see its progress or improve it to be better. It is a skill that is required for employees to know the basics. Having skilled individuals develop systems is necessary since AI currently lacks that ability. Training people to have technology knowledge will be beneficial yet challenging for companies when they shift to generative AI, as it can be expensive. Users also need to accept this new reality. They will need to put trust in a company to continue being a loyal customer. I was scared to order products online and relied on a business to protect my information. Businesses need to ensure customers that their generative AI system is protected and reliable. AI is a benefit to get production growing efficiently, but it also is something to monitor."
1190,S0230,4,"1.	Generative AI will be an easy win for companies that are able to implement the technology into their operations.  However, applying the technology will be complex and require strategic planning for success. A few issues were presented from a strategic standpoint when discussing Generative AI in your corporation. One of the main problems falls squarely on the use cases. The poster speaks on stakeholders not necessarily having a holistic view of Generative AI.  Much of what we’ve seen is what’s out there now. Stakeholders may be unable to articulate what they would like Generative AI to provide to their customers.  Without set use cases available, this can be a difficult ride for leadership even to comprehend.  Others have also pointed out that companies are pushing toward AI but have not done an exercise on the spending.  If an effort is made to understand the spend on AI vs your current influx of requests and development on production, one will have to make the decision on whether AI takes a backseat to what is currently led by the DevOps team."
1191,S0231,4,"	The key challenges when applying generative AI to an innovative idea for achieving strategic benefits for an organization include: data security/privacy, data accuracy, and the cost. With generative AI you must be careful with the way you use it, and that you are able to protect any confidential information your business holds. You also need to make sure that the data sets you are using in generative AI are using the correct data and that the task given is correct. With programming and coding these generative AI functions you need to check that the code doesn’t have any errors to ensure accuracy. The cost of generative AI is another challenge for most organizations. They must question whether it is worth it to develop generative AI to do repetitive tasks instead of the cost of a person to do it.  Most of the costs of generative AI go into developing the software, and making sure the functionality is correct with testing. Another challenge when applying generative AI is an organization seeing how generative AI would fit into their organization. This cost of trial and error to achieve company success is a big challenge that organizations face daily. With proper application, generative AI will be successful from these challenges."
1192,S0232,4,"There are several key challenges when applying generative AI to an innovative idea for an organization. The first challenge would be whether the source of the data is accurate, the second would be the quality of the data and the third would be availability of the data. 
These AI models need to be trained and provided the data and this takes time and quality training in order to ensure that the information that is sourced is accurate. 
Creating content to sound as if it came from a human is something challenging for any organization. As we spoke in the last question there are many legal implications, and ethical implications as well, because you want to provide information that is authentic to the organization. 

"
1193,S0233,4,"In order to get the most out of your interactions with artificial intelligence, you must
know how to use it properly. Getting a good response can be tricky, especially in developmental
AI such as art generation. It’s like speaking a language. Although it’s English , you have to
allow the program to understand what you want from them. Often, giving a purpose as to why
you have a certain task allows the program to apply context. This may give you an answer that is
well-suited to your needs.
There’s also an importance to give the program reliable and useful data to work with.
This will give you more accurate results. Everything stacks, so if you mess up in this part you
may find yourself with some confusing answers. Part of providing reliable data also has to do
with making sure there is as little bias as possible within the program. It is the human’s job to
interpret results, therefore we want as objective of an answer as possible."
1194,S0234,4,"Generative AI can be applied in business settings in many various ways. Generative AI can help organizations with innovating in order to achieve a strategic advantage over other organizations. This technology can be used in many different ways for businesses, such as creating a business plan to scale up the organization or simulating conversations from top executives from theoretical companies in order to gain more insights. Some of the biggest challenges one can face when trying to use this technology in such a way would be other competitors having the same access to the same tools being used, creating similar business plans which could eliminate one’s competitive advantage. Another challenge would be the limitations of the technology itself. Although the technology can be useful in aiding in innovation, in its current state, it is fairly simple and generic, but it can be used as a good starting point. Another challenge for using generative AI to gain a competitive advantage would be writing the actual prompt. It is important to be as detailed as possible so that the AI can give you the best possible response for the particular situation. One final challenge with using generative AI to gain a competitive advantage in a business setting would be the potential for eliminating jobs and losing the human interaction aspect of your product or service. For instance, companies using AI for customer service support purposes eliminates jobs and could potentially frustrate customers more than a human would. "
1195,S0235,4," While many challenges will certainly arise when attempting to implement
generative AI to innovative ideas for strategic benefits, I’ve learned that the biggest concerns
pertain to if the generative AI will produce outputs that align with the company’s business
model. Users have found that generative AI may not produce information and insight relevant to
the specific business model of the organization. Many organizations may be faced with very
specific problems that generative AI may not have the best solution for."
1196,S0236,4,"One of the main challenges I found was that the bias concerns that generative AI models can have issues with. Since these models can learn biases without meaning to, the data must be ensured that it creates fair and responsible content. Another challenge I found when applying generative AI to an innovative idea for achieving strategic benefits for an organization is regulations within countries. Since AI models such as these are relatively new, regulations regarding the sensitive data these models hold can cause strict rules that may hamper the free use of these models within organizations, especially if they are international. This also leads into an increased risk of security issues, since AI models are vulnerable to attacks and hacking that can threaten vital information held within an organization. Organizations must ensure that cybersecurity threats are preventable when using these models. Lastly, another challenge found in the community is that integrating AI into existing organizations can be difficult. Changes in processes and training employees is costly and time-consuming, so the integration of these models is not easy and can cause a lot of disruption within the organization. Organizations must be aware of all of these challenges and create a clear strategy that will allow the use of generative AI to be responsible and effective.
"
1197,S0237,4," Lastly for challenges when applying a generative AI to a new idea can be 
great but generative AI models need a lot of high-quality data. Such data can be expensive and 
time-consuming to acquire and manage over time.  "
1198,S0238,4,"	Due to Generative AI using other ideas to create new combinations of ideas, Generative AI can struggle to create something out of a new idea due to the lack of information on the idea. However generative AI is good at finding similarities between ideas, and can create information based on that.
	Generative AI may also not produce results that are usable to an organization. Generative AI is not a human, and can possibly generate information that is a mashup of ideas in the wrong way, creating a mess of information. This is why developers must optimize their Generative AIs to create information that is usable. However sometimes concepts can be so unique, or out of the realm of the AI, that it simply can not make a decision.
	Another issue is that Generative AI may produce results that violate copyright and intellectual property rights of others. Due to Generative AI using other information, some copyrighted information can be copied into content created by generative AI. 
	All of these actors can hinder decision making by an organization as it looks to an AI that may not produce usable information, or gets the organization in trouble when it is using the content of others without compensation. 
"
1199,S0239,4,"One key challenge will be getting the generative AI to understand the intricate details of the business, the market, and the nuances of the customers to get better innovative ideas than a person who has studied and been employed to create innovative ideas. Creating an innovative idea is not the hardest thing in the world, but creating an innovative idea built for the company and the goals they have is much more specific than current generative AI is capable of. With that being said, with the capabilities and advancements technology can have at such a fast rate, it is likely that many challenges can be worked out with time and the fine tuning and improvement of generative AI. Especially with big tech companies and the large amounts of money they have, if they see a large value upside, they will be driven to find ways to continuously fix challenges as they discover them."
1200,S0240,4,"The issues with implementing generative AI to achieve strategic benefits is that
generative AI is a relatively new concept and therefore quite flawed. The demand for
resources for generative AI to perform correctly is extensive. Generative AI relies on past
data models to establish new models for users thus it needs a vast amount of resources to
pull from. That library itself needs to be cleansed and appropriately sorted to be utilized.
The amount of data storage needed to hold that information is also extensive; more
complex generative AI programs would need more data. The basis of generative AI
programming is also complex. Deep learning is based on artificial neural networks that
are supposed to function without human intelligence thus the system must be able to
function on its own."
1201,S0241,4,"The main challenge concerning AI as a means to achieving strategic benefit imposes the same issues discussed above. There are privacy concerns, devaluation concerns, the need for human intervention still exists, and bias is relevant in the discussion since AI has almost unrestricted access to all and any data, and with companies that may suggest or attempt to fulfill specific agendas, powerful AI’s under that bias can wreak havoc. The main concern is losing the touch of human that most of us desire when we call and immediately request to speak to a representative, but that also may change considering the advancements and growth of AI technology that may really mitigate the need for rhumnas. "
1202,S0242,4,"	Based on the posts I’ve come across from the other questions, one of the key challenges when applying generative AI to an innovative idea for strategic benefits for an organization may be if the AI is trained to do the task that is being asked. There are certain AI tools that are trained to do different things. For example, ChatGPT isn’t primarily trained for generating images or analyzing images, whereas another AI tool may be. So, finding a different generative AI tool that is optimized for the task may be a challenge. If your innovative idea involves writing code, you wouldn’t use AI that is trained to generate images. 
	Another key challenge is the legality and ethics of the generative AI being used. As explored in Question 3, imitation of a real human may not be considered ethical. If AI is being used to deceive someone, such as the customer of an organization, customers may find it unethical and find a way to sue the organization. Also, if the organization is located in the EU, due to the new AI law, there are transparency requirements that the organization must abide by if they want to use generative AI. Organizations must disclose that content is generated by AI, and also train the model to prevent it from generating illegal content.
"
1203,S0243,4,"Key challenges regarding using generative AI to an innovating idea when achieving strategic benefits usually would reside in the generative AI program itself, at least, I imagine it so. This is because, though generative AI itself seems like a self-sufficient entity, it needs to be treated almost as a human through feedback and evaluation. Evaluation is a key foundation when it comes to building a proper generative AI, and it is stated that this evaluation has to be done with human judgement. Evaluating the quality of output is subjective and it relies on visual inspection, user feedback, and specific domain measures. The challenge, in my mind, isn’t with the need for evaluation of the AI, rather, the need for human input in this process. As we all are very aware, humans are not perfect, and are rather imperfect. Thus, the need for human input has the potential to be the downfall of a certain generative AI. In a way, the problem doesn’t reside within the AI itself, but the guidelines and possible measures that are used to condition and teach the AI. This would lead to conflicts in the AI and, thus, ruin the potential for strategic benefits in business."
1204,S0244,4,"It could prove challenging to get the AI to conform to exactly what you are looking for. Strategic benefits would
often be very specific details concerning the orginization and the market it is in or other competition. At
the moment it could prove difficult to do this with only the use of chat gpt or other basic AI. Another issue is
data sources for training. Computer power for training and the limitations of AI being that it's often
wrong, requires more data and computer power research for less inefectancy problems.One of the
biggest concerns when implementing generative AI is integration with systems and data. These older
systems are often difficult to change and integrate, making new AI technologies seem like a difficult task.
If organizations rely to heavily on AI it can come in contact with this difficulty, which would be that the
systems could become biased.Generative AI systems are trained on data that is created by humans.
If this data is biased, the system will learn to be biased as well. This could lead to the system making
decisions that discriminate against certain groups of people. Companies should do more research on AI and try
To eliminate any error that can occur within the AI."
1205,S0245,4,"This answer focuses on the challenge that generative AI has with being very specific. I think they make a good point. There are many generative AI that use pretty general information to answer questions and provide information. Being able to get a specific answer for a complicated data set will be a challenge. Another difficulty could lie in the generative AI not having human features such as real emotions. Although there may be times where an objective opinion or way of thinking is the best strategy, there are also many times where thinking about how a new strategy affects the workers of an organization is more important. Here is another answer that I received:  
This answer focuses more on the programming function of using generative AI. They say that AI has limitations, and they can often provide incorrect information. This can be seen when asking ChatGPT to solve a somewhat complicated finance or economics question; it will not be correct too often. Furthermore, this user brings up the idea that much more data and computer power must be used in order to solve complicated questions or situations. I can understand that being an issue, especially with smaller companies or organizations that don’t have the funds to invest in high-tech computers. Along with the price of using the generative AI, smaller organizations may not have people that are comfortable or have experience with using AI. 
"
1206,S0246,4,"One of the key issues I understood regarding generative AI being applied to innovation is if it may undo
the innovation. Let me explain the generative AI system must be trained using a data set created and
from there it is able to learn and create new responses using existing data. However, if it relies on
combinations of existing data can it truly be innovated? One of the subreddits has a video discussing if
generative AI can fall under the category of plagiarism as it can be argued it is not an original idea. If
organizations are using this without clear regulations, I think they it led to many issues of copyright.
Furthermore, since the information the AI generative is not technically new if the organization does not
know where it originates, they may use a concept that has already been used and even adapted
somewhere else. For example, let’s say they use generative AI in trying to innovate a products
production process. The AI may provide information of a way to “innovate” the process that has already
been created and perfected somewhere else. So instead of adapting the new organization may fall
behind. Another issue with applying Generative AI to innovative ideas is that it may not follow the
production process of humans. One of the posts talked about creating personalized advertisement for
individuals using AI, however, AI may be able to generate aspects of products that are yet to be produced
by the company leading the company being accused of false advertisement if the AI creations are not
evaluated properly."
1207,S0247,4,"•	The biggest challenge in the implementation of AI is the cost. Most companies can not afford or see the value in implementing AI into their system, which, at the moment, is too expensive. For a company with the funds to implement the platform, the data produced by the generative AI is based solely on the training data it was given. The data may not be extensive enough for the AI to provide meaningful data. It may take multiple tries to get the type of response you want. However, the AI data can be traced back to the platform, so legal issues may occur due to privacy rights policies being broken. The next challenge is understanding if the data provided has bias; this is hard to do because, in the form of updates and usage, the AI might favor specific responses that would go unseen. It would also format its answers similarly to other questions it has been asked. This would mean the similarity of solutions would be apparent, and if that is the case, it shows there is a lack of quantity for actual data. If the question or prompt is not formatted correctly, the AI may not give you what is asked for and provide low-quality or quantity responses. AI may also have trouble following the companies’ guidelines. All these reasons lead to the understanding that employees need to interpret the data and make it their own work for the data to have meaning and value; AI should be used as a starting point, not considered a draft of the final product."

1209,S0249,4,"Challenges in the workplace are always prevalent, but with the rise of a new innovation such as generative AI, all levels of the organization will face challenges that associate with AI. One challenge that could come up, is how will the AI interact with the current system that an organization is using. Will it be possible to bring everything together, or, will you need to start from the ground up again and rebuild a new system that goes hand in hand with AI. These questions must be answered before implementing it into the system. One other challenge that you could find in the workplace is finding people that have worked with AI before and bringing them into the organization. You can choose a different route by training current employees to work with AI. One last challenge that could come up, is the obviously the cost of everything, such as; workstations, software, and also personal that comes from hiring new employees that work with AI. With these challenges that come up with working and bring AI into the workplace they must be resolved and if that is a good or bad thing is up to interpretation for the people that run these organizations. Personally, I believe that it is completely worth it to invest in AI technology with the benefits far outweigh the disadvantages. 

"
1210,S0250,4,"Although using AI is beneficial in many ways, there are still some Key challenges when applying generative AI to an innovative idea for achieving strategic benefits for an organization. One of the key challenges is that AI does not fully understand human nature and art of the language. In the post below demonstrate the examples of that. This person asks the chatgpt to interpret the conversation that makes sense to normal humans. However, chatgpt couldn’t interpret the text because it didn’t understand idiom. As illustrated, AI has limitation for understanding slangs or metaphors that humans usually involve in their conversation. Additionally, they don’t understand the nuance and tone of the text. Which can potentially make the customers frustrated when they are using chatbot. Understanding the emotional context and intent behind the words is a complex task for AI because those are things that goes beyond verbal communications. Creator and developers need to take into considerations that humans communicate verbally but also nonverbally through body language, facial expression, tone, etc. Another challenge is the potential biases that AI can bring in when customers are using chatbot. It can inadvertently come up with biased or inappropriate response. Which can potentially damage organization’s reputation. Coming up with solutions to combat these issues will be next step to develop generative AI. 
 
"
1211,S0251,4,"When applying generative AI for innovative ideas in organizations, data quality and 
quantity are pivotal. Data Quality: High-quality data is vital for accurate AI outcomes. Challenges include ensuring data accuracy, consistency across sources, mitigation of 
bias, and relevance to the specific problem. Data Quantity: Generative AI often 
demands substantial data volumes. Gathering, labeling, storing, and processing data 
can be resource intensive. Privacy and class imbalance issues must also be addressed. 
Organizations must invest in data quality assurance, governance, and augmentation 
techniques while balancing quantity with quality. These considerations are crucial to 
the success of AI-driven innovations and strategic benefits. 
Data relevance plays a pivotal role in the training of generative AI models within 
organizational contexts. It touches upon several critical aspects, including precision in 
learning, quality of results, resource efficiency, bias mitigation, domain expertise, 
generalization, and user satisfaction. When data is irrelevant, it introduces noise into 
the learning process, leading to off-target outputs and reduced quality of AI-generated 
insights. This inefficiency not only wastes resources but also hampers model accuracy. 
Data relevance is also crucial for mitigating bias and requires domain expertise to 
identify pertinent data. Moreover, relevant data empowers models to generalize 
effectively and ensures user satisfaction in applications like virtual assistants. To 
navigate this challenge effectively, organizations must establish precise objectives, 
curate high-quality data, maintain ongoing assessments of data relevance, and 
rigorously scrutinize data for biases. In summary, data relevance is the linchpin for 
achieving precision, value, and ethical AI outcomes in generative AI applications. "
1212,S0252,4,"From reading user posts, it seems like one of the biggest challenges in regards to using generative AI to achieve strategic benefits for a business is data quality and data quantity. Since generative AI uses existing data sets to create new information, the data required for the AI generative service to create this new information has to be considered. Filtering through data, so that it is concise and easy for the AI service to understand is crucial. Unfortunately, processing and filtering data can be an expensive process, as data is not cheap. Another potential challenge that I saw on the OKC is the computer power required to run more complicated AI services, such as marketing development and code generation. This requires a much higher level of computational power, which can not only be expensive in terms of the computer parts required, but also uses more power which in turn will raise the electric bill significantly. 

"
1213,S0253,4,"The one thing I immediately thought of when reading this question, was the cost. In order to create and develop a high-functioning AI system there will require a very large investment, not only in developing the software itself, but also in the experts that will be needed to make this possible. There is also the possibility of failure, not only in the development stage but in the launch and functionality of the AI. The organization wanting to use generative AI to achieve strategic benefits will need to be clear on what their desired outcome will be to determine the integration of generative AI successful. Another challenge is that the speed at which AI and AI technology is progressing, if developers using generative AI for organization strategic benefits may have to rush to find solution to not get “left behind” with the emerging technology. If for any reason they should fall behind, they would have other updates and changes that would further delay the launch of the planned strategy. Once generative AI is established it will also need to be closely monitored to ensure the results align with what the organization wants. Ultimately, if all goes well with development of the system, the organization will have to continually revise and update the system to be up to date with the needs and usage of the system.

Just like generic brands vs. brand names in the grocery store, we usually go for the brand name for reasons such as it's the most liked; we’ve used it before; we’re comfortable with it. For AI benefits to become innovative, I think it needs to challenge those that are already doing good or become a disruptive innovation. Another issue I see is that many people see strategies like chatbots as simple and not helpful. Some don’t understand how to use the chatbot, and some would rather speak to a person right away. For generative AI strategies to be successful, they either need to be 1.) shown similar to humans, and 2.) get people used to generative AI. Getting them used to it will take time, but showing it similar to humans can come with backlash. Finally, generative AI is not mistake-free. Just like humans, AI mistakes will be made if their path to completing the task isn’t clear, which will get a lot of backlash because the general narrative of AI is that it's a perfect robot. Many people get angry at human representative mistakes; AI representatives will get double. Again, people need time to get used to generative AI and see the possibilities the future holds with it. "
1215,S0255,4,"	While generative AI is something that is based on the internet, there are still real worldly things that can power it. The internet itself is something we cannot see or touch with our bare hands, but all of the pillars that keep it running and stable are. These components are no different for AI. As we see different countries trying to implement and accelerate machine learning, or generative AI, into their programs, we will see countries oppress companies that create the real life materials that help operate these complex systems. Companies are not only going to have to implement generative AI into their programs, but they will also have to make sure they are legally allowed to do so. If we see more restrictions like the one mentioned in the post above, it will become increasingly harder to expand on AI when trying to create strategic opportunity and monetarily benefits. Companies are already implementing things like blockchain into their code, to try and continuously move toward a more tech savvy way of doing business. Now these same companies want to create faster models by using generative AI, which will become a lot more difficult if there seems to be a political advantage to try and to hoard the resources for AI."
1216,S0256,4,"o	There are two main challenges when applying generative AI to an innovative idea for achieving strategic benefits for an organization. Firstly, you must train employees to both understand and use generative AI. This can be especially difficult for employees who are not technologically coherent. Also, individuals may struggle to understand the concepts of generative AI. Employees lack of understanding can lead to misuse, skewed data, & insufficient final products. The training will also take time and money, which some employers do not have the ability to spare. Secondarily, generative AI requires a large quantity of data to work. Many smaller companies will not have the data to support generative AI. Furthermore, skewed source data will lead to skewed outputs from generative AI. Without proper source data, it is impossible for generative AI to be effective within an organization. For the benefits to outweigh the costs, the data must be clean, plentiful, & representative. The employers must be able to afford the cost of training & getting the generative AI. Finally, the employees must be willing to learn how to effectively use generative AI. Overall, generative AI can be a very useful tool for organizations. If used properly, it can achieve huge strategic benefits for both employers and employees."
1217,S0257,4,"Implementing AI systems can be expensive, especially for small and medium-sized businesses. The costs include acquiring the necessary hardware, software, and skilled personnel for development and maintenance. Building and deploying AI models require specialized skills in machine learning and data science. A shortage of qualified professionals in these fields can make it challenging for businesses to find or afford the talent needed for successful AI implementation. AI models heavily depend on high-quality data for training and making accurate predictions. Many businesses may struggle with data quality issues, incomplete datasets, or a lack of relevant data needed to train effective models. Integrating AI solutions into existing business processes and systems can be complex. Ensuring compatibility and interoperability with existing infrastructure is a common challenge. There are also ethical concerns that have already been mentioned that prevent companies that want to avoid facing controversy from adopting AI technology into their operations. Some businesses may be hesitant to invest in AI due to concerns about the uncertainty of returns on investment. Demonstrating the tangible benefits and Return On Investment of AI initiatives is crucial for widespread adoption. There are a large number of uncertainties surrounding AI technology that companies are not experienced with. Only companies that can afford the risk are able to utilize this technology for other companies to follow in their example.

1218,S0258,4,"●	Using generative AI can be very tricky if you do not have the right prompts to put in. Generative AI models require large amounts of data to learn and generate high-quality outputs. This can be a challenge for organizations that do not have access to sufficient data, or that have data that is not in a format that is compatible with generative AI models. For smaller companies, they may not have the resources to be able to provide generative AI with the data it needs to produce the content these companies are looking for. Along with that, for example, if you are using ChatGPT to write SEO for a plumbing company, a lot of the time, it is hard to put in the right prompt and information to allow ChatGPT to give you the content that you are looking for. A lot of the time, people are not specific enough with ChatGPT which is why they don’t get the results they are looking for. Understanding how these AI models work can also be tough, and it's hard to explain why they do what they do, which makes it tricky to trust them for important things. Imagine if a robot gave you answers, but you couldn't understand how it arrived at them.

"
1219,S0259,4," Utilizing generative AI to implement innovative strategies within an organization can be 
 very beneficial, but can sometimes present challenges that must be carefully handled to 
 ensure success. Generative AI models require large amounts of high-quality data for 
 effective training, which can be a resource-intensive and time-consuming process. 
 These models can inherit biases from their training data, demanding continuous 
 monitoring and adjustments to maintain fairness and counteract discrimination. 
 Ethical concerns come to the forefront when generative AI mimics human-generated 
 content or generates deep fake materials, prompting organizations to establish ethical 
 frameworks to protect their reputation. In an environment of evolving AI regulations, 
 ensuring compliance with data protection, intellectual property, and other pertinent laws 
 is imperative to avoid legal repercussions. 
 Generative AI models sometimes use ""black-box"" systems, lacking transparency in 
 decision-making processes, which can hinder trust, accountability, and regulatory 
 adherence. The resource-intensive nature of developing and deploying these models  requires significant investments in computational infrastructure, expertise, and ongoing 
 maintenance. 
 Integrating generative AI into existing organizational workflows and systems can be 
 intricate, necessitating compatibility and minimal disruption to established processes. 
 User acceptance can also pose a challenge, as end-users may harbor reservations 
 about interacting with AI-generated content. Building user trust through transparent 
 communication is essential for fostering acceptance and adoption. 
 Security and privacy concerns arise, as generative AI models can be susceptible to 
 adversarial attacks that jeopardize an organization's data and system security. Robust 
 cybersecurity measures and data protection protocols are crucial safeguards. 
 Additionally, quantifying the return on investment (ROI) for generative AI projects can be 
 intricate, particularly when benefits are indirect or long-term. Developing appropriate 
 metrics and measurement frameworks is essential for justifying investments. 
 As organizations grow, the scalability and maintenance of AI systems become 
 increasingly complex. It is crucial to ensure that AI solutions remain adaptable and 
 capable of evolving alongside changing organizational needs. Addressing these 
 multifaceted challenges requires a comprehensive approach to AI implementation. 
 Organizations should conduct thorough feasibility studies, engage with AI experts, and 
 prioritize ethical considerations to navigate the evolving landscape of generative AI 
 technology successfully. "
1220,S0260,4,"Applying generative AI for strategic benefits in organizations presents several key challenges. First, acquiring and curating high-quality training data is resource-intensive and time-consuming. Selecting the most suitable generative AI model for specific tasks can be complex and may require substantial computational resources and expertise. Ensuring ethical use of AI is crucial, with a focus on mitigating biases and maintaining transparency. The limited interpretability of AI models hinders understanding and trust. Navigating evolving regulatory compliance and integrating AI into existing workflows may demand significant adjustments. Balancing human-AI collaboration, especially in creative or decision-making roles, requires careful management. Security and privacy concerns, cost considerations, and the cultural shift needed for AI adoption further complicate the process. Addressing these challenges demands a holistic approach involving experts in data science, ethics, compliance, and change management to maximize the strategic benefits of generative AI. . Organizations must address these challenges with a multidisciplinary approach, involving data science, ethics, compliance, and change management experts to maximize the strategic benefits of generative AI effectively.

1221,S0261,4,"	The key challenges when applying generative AI to an innovative idea are assuring quality, customization, and integration into the workplace. When it comes to quality, AI generated information or recommendations may not always meet the businesses quality standards; it can also be blatantly incorrect. AI, especially in the use of a business needs human oversight to re-check and maintain quality; this assures that no errors, bias, or inappropriate information is released into the public. Additionally, generative AI relies heavily on data which can sometimes make it lack in some aspects of creativity. AI models and styles may not line up with a company’s goals or idea patterns and it raises the challenge that AI may not be fully customizable to a specific company’s aesthetic. For example, an AI generated image might not fully meet the standards of a company needing an ad. Lastly, because many organizations already have a set system of how they operate in terms of already hired employees, and strategies for concepts like marketing, integrating generative AI into ongoing workflows can be difficult. Especially when it comes to incorporating AI into customer service systems or websites, companies must make sure the AI is compatible with their existing services. Additionally, it’s important for the AI to not compromise data security, and adequate security measures must be implemented to protect customer information. "
1222,S0262,4,"The key challenges to applying generative AI is that it will require a large quantity of data
and computational resources. Considering the fact that this is an AI, there will also be a need for
human oversight for ethical considerations. Decisions made by AI are susceptible to
inaccuracies, and can be discriminatory and/or biased in some way, shape or form."
1223,S0263,4,"Some of the key challenges of applying generative AI are the lack of control when it comes to using this software. I think although generative AI can be a very useful technology, it is still relatively new and has a lot of unknowns. I think with the human element monitoring these systems it will give a lot more benefits to any organization. As far as strategic benefits, generative AI can work, process, and generate content at a much higher rate than humans can on their own. The biggest challenge that comes to mind for me has to do with control and understanding. If we don’t understand how and why the system interacts the way, it does. If we learn how to regulate and have some control, I think it enables us to test the full capabilities of generative AI. Once we have the understanding and control, generative AI can supplement achieving strategic benefits. 
"
1224,S0264,4,"-	As stated with the previous questions, there are still many concerns ethically speaking when it comes to generative AI in organization settings. Addressing and implementing solutions for these concerns is an extremely important key challenge when being able to apply generative AI in a way that is strategically beneficial for an organization. Such as privacy concerns with data. Additionally, another key challenge or area of concern would be the amount of data required to successfully train the generative AI and whether a company has enough sufficient data to meet those demands. Like all technology, there is still room for errors to occur and it's important to make sure that there are checks for the system to ensure that the results and content produced are accurate as well as reliable for the company's needs. Another point of challenge will be implementing the system of generative AI effectively for current employees and the current workflow of the organization. It may be easy to get carried away with the capabilities available with generative AI but if something which can cause improvements is not properly implemented, no matter how much of a capacity for improvement there could be, it will not be successful. There are many benefits to generative AI and if these points of contention can be met, generative AI can help promote much success in terms of innovation of ideas in an organization."
1225,S0265,4,"It is important to recognize multiple things when implementing generative AI in an innovative idea. Some examples from the post I am referencing is first to know that the data is sensitive and to pay attention to all the algorithms in the AI. It is very important to recognize the restrictions in the AI so that you are not implementing anything that should not be included. Another important thing to look out for is to become aware with exactly you are getting yourself into cost wise. To properly utilize these services, it will take some time and proper planning to use the certain resources. After doing more research on generative AI, I have realized how much time and effort it takes into using these sources. You must be smart and know what you are getting yourself into. The people in charge must recognize all the terms and conditions in order to properly use it. Everything that I discussed in the ethical and logical issues apply to implantation AI into a workplace as well. Making sure that everything is being double checked and applied in an orderly way, AI is a great source to utilize in any workplace or especially for innovation purposes. "
1226,S0266,4,"Using generative AI to do intelligent things in organizations is great, but it also comes
with some problems. One big issue is making sure the information it uses is excellent
and fair. If the AI learns from data that's not good or is a bit unfair, it can mess up what it
does. Another tricky part is understanding why the AI makes conﬁdent choices. It's like
ﬁguring out why a friend picked one game over another but sometimes, it's not easy to
know. This is also a challenge with generative AI when understanding how it decides
things. Putting generative AI into the everyday work we do can also be challenging. So,
organizations have to work out how to make generative AI work well with what they
already have. In my previous job, we needed to have the creative assets made but we
can use the AI to put together the video we wanted. Organizations need to deal with
these challenges to make generative AI really helpful. They must ensure the information
they use is good, understand why it does things, and ﬁt it smoothly into their regular
work. This way, they can use generative AI thoughtfully and reasonably, getting all the
good things it can bring while making sure it's used the right way."
1227,S0267,4,"AI can pose quite a few challenges when it comes to its application to products and 
services for strategic purposes.  They would have to make sure that the data quality is good and 
not something that could mislead them because it produced misleading data.  AI needs to be 
trained heavily in order to produce the best data possible.  Security is also a big concern, 
making sure those who do not have unauthorized  access get a hold of the AI to do something 
malicious.  They also have to make sure that the AI is not vulnerable to attacks by hackers and 
ransomware.  People who access it may be able to hurt a company and release sensitive files to 
the public.  There are also ethical concerns that content it produces and does not give off biases 
towards something.  Ethical considerations need to be thought of when training the AI.  
Something else that should be noted is regulatory compliance. There are a lot of laws 
concerning privacy, copyright, and industry standards that AI must be aware of.  There is also a 
human aspect that some people may have trouble adjusting to.  Older folk who are not well

1228,S0268,4,"There are a few key challenges when applying generative AI to an innovative idea for achieving
strategic benefits for an organization. These challenges can include data quality (biases), level
of autonomy, or even developmental processes. When it comes to the data quality, having a
good set of data is crucial in order to receive any useful output. This also includes ensuring that
the data being used has as little bias as possible. This bias can be introduced through a number
of ways such as how historical data is compiled, or even unintentionally through the human
curator. Additionally, generative AI may appear to lessen the workload allowing for work to be
completed faster and cheaper; however, attempting to reach a higher level of autonomy at the
expense of employees can have negative implications. A balance must be found within the
correlation of human involvement and autonomy in order to achieve success. This balance must
also be applied during the developmental process in which having the personnel for creating
innovative ideas can become expensive. In order to start development when applying
generative AI to innovative ideas, the right people have to be brought on board. These are
typically the people with training and experience in a discipline of computer science and/or
machine learning. Having the people with the right skill set can make or break an idea."
1229,S0269,4,"There are many challenges that organizations face when trying to apply generative AI to promote innovation to achieve strategic goals and benefits for an organization. For example, Amazon has recently dedicated a very large amount of funding into a unique project called the “AWS generative AI Innovation Center”, which is designed to promote, encourage, incentivize, and develop growth of generative AI knowledge and skills. This initiative will pay off for Amazon if the  organization manages to accomplish its goals of fostering such innovation. However, I could see the challenges that a company could face when trying to perform such a feat. For example, despite getting over $100 million dollars invested into this center, the fast of generative technology itself could wildly fluctuate just how much funding will actually be needed. Additionally, the risk of competition in the form of similar organizations or disruptors can pose a significant threat. Moreover, with the development of other generative AI technologies, most notably ChatGPT, they may have competing with GPT’s image. Lastly, when dealing with such technologies, you need qualified people to not only manage the technological development, but also to maintain classified information and manage the legal and ethical fallout of any major crisis involving this development."
1230,S0270,4," The biggest challenge of machine learning systems is the amount of data required to operate the system. As mentioned in question no. 3, AI companies need to be aware of how they gather data, where the data comes from, and how to find it. Data can be expensive and hard to obtain. Furthermore, more ethical considerations need to clearly define the company to avoid any legal issues later in development. Even with consent, AI companies are responsible for the information they hold. Security and data privacy must be a priority for the sake of the community. Ensuring accuracy and quality is another challenge AI companies face. Generative services are becoming widely available. As more and more organizations invest in machine learning accuracy becomes a competitive advantage. The AI program that produces the quickest, quality answers is the one that will develop trust among the public. Technical issues may produce problems as well. Integrating with other software may be complex and require adjustments to both systems. Developers and IT departments need to communicate regularly to ensure a seamless integration of both systems. Finally, what are the goals of the AI developers? Is the system meant to be used for general information, creativity, productivity, or service? If large datasets are needed to create a base for training, then the company may need to define it’s goals to save time and resources associated with developing such a taxing service. "

1232,S0272,4,It was surprisingly difficult to find information on this topic specifically. I can think of a few challenges simply based on personal experience and word of mouth but I was not able to find much on the OKC. I found one post that outlines some of the main challenges they have had with AI. The first concern was the current hardware at most organizations. Unless they are primarily a tech entity it might be difficult for some organizations to use demanding AI simply due to their tech compatibility. The second challenge they offered which I think is the most important challenge to focus on is the “learning from data” part of AI. This is important because that is how the AI learns and if you show subpar data then the results will be subpar. To make sure the AI is learning the correct way would require direct human supervision which diminishes some of the benefits of AI. The other important challenges with AI is the causality and reasoning. To get the AI to understand common sense and extract the right data and patterns from a data set will require great focus and teamwork. The point of AI is defeated if it takes more work to have the AI complete the work rather than doing it yourself.
1233,S0273,4,"This question was very interesting to research and answer. I believe the main challenge would be just knowing if the quality of data you are getting is good enough to put to use. While generative AI is very innovative and can come up with great ideas, sometimes the quality of data you get may just not be good enough. Making sure the quality of data is good enough can also be difficult to measure. This also ties in to whether the data you get is updated enough to apply to their current business climate. Another challenge could also be that the generative AI model may just not be able to answer complex problems. Some data in these models is still new and basic and you may not be able to get enough technical answers from the models. Lastly, I believe a big challenge could be integrating the data into an organization. What I mean by this is, you can get all the data you need, but you also need a skilled and competent workforce to convert the data you get into success. I believe these are the key challenges into applying generative AI to an innovative idea for achieving strategic benefits for an organization. "
1234,S0274,4," There are many challenges that generative AI faces especially when applying an
innovative idea for achieving strategic benefits for an organization. One is that users and the organization

by creating data breaches, it can also misuse data by not knowing what is sensitive and what is not.
Generative AI might make it unsafe for users of the organization because it won't adhere to data privacy
laws. Other challenges organizations can face the cost and resource allocation, Generative AI may saveyou money in the long run but it is up to the business to see if it's worth the investment. Generative AI can
be quite costly because you must invest in hardware and software which can be quite expensive for the
company. Lastly, a key challenge an organization can face is talent acquisition and retention, because
generative AI is something that needs to keep evolving it's a challenge to know who to hire to keep up
with the competitiveness of generative AI. The organization will need to know how to keep the drive up

1.	Data Quality and Amount: AI has models that require enormous, top-notch datasets for successful preparation. Obtaining, cleaning, and keeping up with such datasets can be asset escalated and an intense test.
2.	Algorithmic Predisposition: Generative AI models can acquire inclinations from their preparation information which can bring about one-sided and unreasonable outcomes. Ensuring things are fair and relieving predisposition is something testing.
3.	Change Administration: having AI driven cycles can upset existing work processes and may confront obstruction from representatives. Changing the administration methodologies are a must while working with a smooth progress.
4.	Cybersecurity: simulated intelligence frameworks are equipped for being gone after and powerless. Ensuring the man-made intelligence models and information have security is pivotal to forestall breaks and information spills.
5.	Scalability: Increasing man-made intelligence projects from trial and error to full arrangement across an association can challenge. It is basic to ensure that simulated intelligence models can deal with an expanded responsibility.

1237,S0277,4,"The key challenges of applying generative AI to an organization for strategic benefits are vast. Ensuring there is not plagiarism taking place is the most important as it affects the organizations reputation and it is also illegal. Plagiarism is often difficult to detect when it is coming from generative AI as we are to believe that it is completely new information with no risk of it being plagiarized. Ensuring the data received by generative AI is accurate and reliable is crucial to ensure no misinformation is being spread. Risking a person’s privacy for the sake of generative AI is not good for an organization’s reputation, it will appear that the organization does not have respect for a person’s privacy. Violating a person’s consent through having a lack of respect for privacy can be detrimental to an organization’s reputation, making it more difficult to stay in business and avoid controversy. Generative AI is not environmentally conscious as it uses many resources and energy making an organization’s carbon footprint much larger. Employees should be able to become more valuable to a company and not fear that their job is in jeopardy. Although generative AI is more cost effective than employees it is better to ensure people find ways to work with generative AI and not be replaced."
1238,S0278,4,"The most prevalent issues for using generative AI is source data. Since generative AI uses machine learning and pulls pre-existing data from the internet to create its outputs, it can be difficult to generate something truly innovative as it pulls from pre-existing ideas.

The first is data quantity and quality. Organizations need to be able to provide a sufficient amount of data to train the AI model to produce accurate results. Another challenge they face is the model’s explainability and credibility. Organizations may find it difficult to interpret the results generated through the AI model due to its complexity. It may take time for them to understand how results are produced and how to use them. The last, and biggest challenge organizations face, are ethical and legal concerns. As discussed in the previous question, anytime generative AI is used there are questions of ethics and the possibility of copyright infringement. Generative AI can be used to manipulate videos and/or recordings to make things seem like they happened when in reality they did not. It is up to the organization to uphold ethical as well as legal responsibility when they plan to use generative AI."
1240,S0280,4," Creating an innovative idea for strategic benefits in an organization requires large
amounts of data and knowledge. Many times, data has to be collected by people analyzing how
others work in their environment based on observations. This is something that generative AI
can’t do because it requires humans to insert the data for the system to analyze and process.
Generative AI can not make observations and conduct research or experiments like humans can.
Only humans understand the full length of how we interact with each other and the meanings
behind observations. Another challenge would be the level of specification and detail that a user
is expecting out of the generative AI system. It may be difficult for a user to receive the exact
type of information or response they were looking for. It may be a matter of wording the prompt
differently or, more specifically, in order to get the AI to produce the response they expect, but it
would still pose a challenge for users. It may also be a challenge for generative AI to understand
and include figurative language that humans often use. If a user asks generative AI questions or
prompts using figurative language, it may have a difficult time producing an accurate response
that would make sense in certain human interactions or situations, especially when it comes to
business and organizational communication."

Very specific details on your organization and the market you are competing in as well as other competitors would often provide strategic advantages.  The main challenges are to ensure that training data is correct, eliminate the biases in artificial intelligence outputs and deal with possible job displacement as a result of automation. In order to ensure a balance between the automated and human interaction, it is crucial that we succeed in our deployment. Working generating AI in a workplace can present a number of difficulties. Many of these results are due to the human-to-technology changes. These issues may range from personnel setups and training to layoffs and pay reductions. Each of these causes stress and tension within the organization. When implementing the new system, you would need to hire new staff and make additional costs. Each one costs the corporation lots of dollars. While these are excellent challenges, there are a few things that could be improved when it comes to replacing employees and cutting wages. It is difficult to advocate for the retention of workers when these new systems can do the same job as an individual with no pay or breaks in a day. "

The web is so huge with so many databases AI can access making this a very helpful tool but can turn hurtful very quickly if it is not monitored efficiently. The consequences for an organization using AI can be in the way of legal action. I think in the beginning of AI it will help reduce employees in the way of research and content creation, but there will be a new team that has to be implemented to strictly monitor the new AI information being released for the company. Over time I feel AI will be more efficient and the legal loopholes will be slowly figured out.

For example, the ability for these generative AI to produce data and information in a useful way as it pertains to an organization’s innovative ideas and approaches depends on the amount and quality of the data that they have access to and the skills needed to train the models and implement whatever strategy is being used. Aside from the risks associated with the issues mentioned in the previous question, organizational use of generative AI could find difficulties in their own knowledge of utilizing and implementing AI. In a forum topic allowing members to post concerns about AI, some users mentioned the challenge of employees unknowingly providing organization secrets and private information regarding strategies against competition, or in the case of Amazon, providing interview question answers. Training employees well in an organization is essential to limiting or preventing the misuse of generative AI. This is an additional aspect that adds to organization costs.

This can be a drawback because the users of this AI can be influenced by this information and errors can occur in the output of the AI. This creates a bigger challenge because new users of AI might be cautious and unsure of using it due to not trusting the outputs that AI generates due to this information bias. For AI to be useable, biases have to be filtered and corrected so that users can build trust and be able to use it and implement it successfully. Another key challenge of AI is teaching users how to understand it and use it properly. AI is extremely complex and it’s hard to figure out how to input specific information to get a specific output. This can create a problem especially for new users because it can be frustrating to learn a completely new technology. When implementing this into an organization the employees have to be trained on how to use it and be cautious in what they are using it for. They have to keep a constant awareness, caution, and an open mind in order to be able to use it properly. "

1248,S0288,4,"While the innovative possibilities of generative AI are large, so are the challenges in bringing it into organizations. Like discussed earlier generative AI grabs information from many different data sets to make its own version but where is it getting this data? That is the first big issue, making sure the data collected is reliable and non biased. The data cannot be tampered with and must be true data, along with that we also don’t want data that is completely biased and giving results skewed to one side on purpose. There is also the issue I worry about as a student majoring in accounting and that is automation and the loss of jobs. If generative AI gets really good and gets data from reliable sources what is the need for paying humans when you can have AI do it. Many other people such as painters, marketers, and musicians worry about losing out on work due to AI. This then causes another issue and that is employees being accepting and willing to work with generative AI. If the employees dont want to work with or train on AI it is going to be really difficult for companies to begin implementing it into everyday operations. "
1249,S0289,4,"Some key challenges I found in AI included data and familiarity. First, I found data is
extremely important for AI. When you are obtaining, cleaning, and structuring relevant
data if it is not correct it can cause a significant challenge. I also noticed that the
availability of data is there you just have to be able to find it, but I think AI will be able to
adapt to that.
Another challenge that I found was how skilled people were with AI. It is hard to find
professionals and people who are able to understand what AI is, and are able to
advance it. I feel as AI develops the community I found within this platform will become
even larger and even more informed.
Overall, I was able to see that there’s still a lot more information to learn about this
emerging technology in that when it comes to an organization using it, it could really
benefit their strategic mindset and advance them even more. To sum it up even more I
think it’ll help organizations basically think outside the box and become one with AI."

Strategic benefits would often be very specific details concerning your organization and the market it is in or other competition. At the moment it could prove difficult to do this with only the use of chat gpt or other basic AI. In the future, I think almost all challenges could be eliminated.” He thinks that a lot of the key challenges could be eliminated. The challenges are getting good training data, security risks, legality and ethics.  Getting good training data and making sure that it is being used in an ethical and unbiased use. Data quality can also be a challenge because generative models heavily rely on training data and poor quality can lead to inaccurate output. Bias is also a challenge because it can perpetuate bias in training data. Learning all of this I don't believe there are many key challenges that we will have for achieving strategic benefits for an organization and regarding the benefits I think that everyone will solve these challenges very soon. "
1251,S0291,4,"Again, to summarize ChatGPT says that data quality and availability, model selection and tuning, computational resources, ethical and bias consideration, regulatory compliance, integration with existing systems, scalability, security and privacy, human-AI collaboration, intellectual property, monitoring and maintenance, user acceptance, as well as cost-benefit analysis are the most important challenges that an organization may face when applying generative AI for strategic benefits. I do agree with ChatGPT that there are a lot of ethical considerations, biases, compliances, and legal issues that can come into play. Making sure an organization has the proper team to implement this and limit what it will be used for can ensure that this is productive for the organization’s growth. Overcoming the challenges is not easy, but having a team of people who understand it and are able to guide the usage can be very helpful and successfully help the organization. For example, Coca-Cola just released a drink that was co-created with generative AI. The drink is Coca-Cola Zero Sugar Y3000. It is probably just regular Coke Zero, but the fact it was generated and created in collaboration with AI is what makes it so interesting and people are more intrigued with the product."
1252,S0292,4,"From my findings, one of the most difficult things in implementing AI for organizations is implementing it in a way that is ethical. Both in the way that it gets implemented, not leaving many people out of jobs, and also in its functionality, not being ethically questionable to its users external of the organization as customer trust is critical to any organization. Another challenge organizations face in implementing is that AI algorithms require constant refinement. They need new, massive datasets that might not be consistent with reality, and that real dataset might not be available timely. Going along with these constant refinements, implementing AI can get very very expensive quick. There are also a lot of privacy concerns regarding using AI. This goes back to customer trust being very important, as if there are privacy concerns regarding your company why would customers want to have their information associated with your company. The final topic I will touch on in regards to challenges with AI is its inability to understand context. As I’ve discussed earlier, generative AI has no memory, so it is completely unable to understand or utilize context clues, so some of the responses you might get will make no sense."
1253,S0293,4,"-	One of the key challenges to using Generative AI for strategic innovation in a business setting or organizational setting is actually the ethical and legal issues themselves. Labor laws can be created to not allow businesses to implement Generative AI to replace workers. Although stifling business innovation may not be the goal of these laws, there may be a certain extent to which businesses can implement Generative AI to replace workers.
Another challenge can be creating a Generative AI system or model with enough big data and information. Creating a sophisticated Generative AI model can be a lengthy process. They need large, high quality datasets to learn from for effective training. Collecting a sophisticated and large amount of information for a business to train a Generative AI model can be difficult. The financial implications of a company investing in such sophisticated Generative AI models can be heavy on some firms as well. If a small company wants to keep up with the growing demand of Generative AI, how will they be able to afford creating and supplying a Generative AI system with a vast amount of information and data? Having high quality data for a Generative AI model is necessary.
"
1254,S0294,4,"There are several key challenges that comes with applying generative AI to innovative ideas for organizational benefits. One main challenge is data quality and availability. Generative AI relies heavily on extensive datasets to learn and create, and smaller organizations may struggle to obtain high-quality, relevant data. In other cases, data may be scarce, outdated, or biased, which can hinder AI's ability to generate accurate and valuable outcomes. Additionally, privacy concerns may limit access to certain data sources, posing a bottleneck to AI-driven innovation.
Another significant challenge is model complexity and training. Developing and fine-tuning generative AI models can be technically demanding and time-consuming. Small organizations may lack the necessary expertise or resources to build and maintain these models effectively. Moreover, the enormous computational power required for training large AI models can be cost-prohibitive for smaller organizations. Ensuring that the AI model understands and generates content in alignment with society’s and the organization's specific values is also a considerable challenge. Lastly, there's the issue of transparency and accountability. Generative AI systems often operate as autonomous machines, making it challenging to explain their decisions and actions. This lack of transparency can be problematic, especially when dealing with regulatory compliance, ethical considerations, and building trust among stakeholders.

1255,S0295,4,"I think some key challenges are data sources, programming AI to give you exactly what you are looking for. In addition, not only giving you the right answer but making sure that it collects the right data from reliable websites. Training and running generative AI can bring a challenge of creating a perfect strategic idea. The AI would bring the idea to the platform but in order to execute the idea proficiently the company would need to review and revise the AI idea. This would challenge every idea AI creates by having to double check the AI’s work. It would be tedious for a company to recheck any work done by using AI services. AI would have to be simplified and accurate in the future in order for companies to purely rely on the response of an AI generated idea. There are many challenges that come with using AI at this moment due to the AI generated system being so new to this generation. There has to be more work and studies done by the AI generated system to perform at its 100% accurate and best system. "
1256,S0296,4,"The biggest challenge that I can think of in an orientation when striving for strategic benefits from AI is getting the right content generated consistently. Because the technology is so new it can take time to build a perfect model or perfect prompt to get the exact results you need. In my experience, it can take 3+ attempts to get answers to very complex questions from something like ChatGPT. Sometimes the information that you do get is not complete so you have to ask a follow-up question. Problems like this slow down productivity and ruin the whole point of the AI to increase workflow speed that most companies are seeking. Another challenge is recognizing when it's worth using an AI vs. a human. A great example of this is in customer service. Many people prefer to talk with good people. This is the reason why most people instantly try to speak with a representative when contacting a larger company rather than using their response bots to solve their issues. Humans can simply solve more complex problems faster than most bots exist today. Until bots are able to speed up in the customer service world I don't see companies being able to convince consumers to use them over humans."

This can lead to a big risk regarding the corporate’s inner schematics. For example, the Ford Car Company may have a great innovation that may change the auto industry and plan on making record profits for the next decade. If a developer asks for help on AI, this info can easily be gained by AI or security professionals or hackers. It is same as handing out valuable information to competitors.

In the previous question, I discussed and some of the legal and ethical issues like the creation of fake AI nude photos of people. AI can be used with ill intent and can exploit people and companies, as in Figure 6. (ohwellwho, 2023) It is one of the challenges that today’s companies are facing when it comes to strengthening their security on AI systems. According to ChatGPT, it says one of the challenges that AI faces is biased information. Since it is programmed by humans, the data that it is taught can be biased. In the Harvard Business Review, this problem has been occurring for decades. Programs created by humans for a British medical school application was discriminating against female applicants and applicants that did not have names that were European. However, since these programs were written by humans, they would unknowingly only run a biased program. (Manyika et al., 2022) Companies and organizations that are trying to be as inclusive and unbiased as possible by using generative AI, can still be unknowingly biased due to their AI being taught how to be biased.
 
"
1260,S0300,4,"Challenges when applying generative AI to innovative ideas within the workplace are unexpected or inaccurate results, a lack of security, and a requirement for a vast array of historical training data. Because generative AI is a relatively new technology, it is not perfect, and the information that it generates could be better. It is prone to providing inaccurate results or complete fabrications. Secondly, most generative AI platforms are hosted on a cloud computing engine and require data to be delivered to a public cloud. This can be problematic for organizations that value the privacy and ownership of their data and can lead to security issues should the provided data ever become breached. Finally, generative AI demands substantial historical training data to function effectively, posing a hurdle for organizations with limited data resources.

1261,S0301,4,"Some key challenges when applying generative AI to an innovative idea for an organization could be the pattern an AI model follows might not be 100% accurate or fair, people in the company may not believe in using AI, potential security risks with using this technology and the cost of this advanced technology. AI is developing fast but there are many concerns around using it in everyday lives and in the business world. 
    To start, like I explained earlier, generative AI creates outputs by studying patterns within neural networks. So, if an organization develops an AI system but uses a non-neutral standpoint, it could rig the whole system. This could create inaccurate and bias generations, which can create a distrust in the process. Along with this, some people may even be against using AI due to the lack of knowledge around it. They may have issues believing what is being said, don’t like the security risk that goes along with it, and may not like the idea of technology doing the job they could be doing. It is still new and scary to many people especially when it comes to putting trust in it.
    Lastly, this advanced technology is does come at a cost. Not only will it be expensive to create this system but also to maintain it over the years as well.  There are many costs that add up fairly quickly which puts companies in a situation to weigh the pros and cons. It is important to stay on top of maintenance to keep information and security as up to standard as possible.

Generative AI can be as challenging as it needs to be specific and concise when making a request. With legal and ethics being in question these can be challenging to avoid and cause stress on management. There can be challenges with quality because generative AI can produce fake mediums. The release of false information can result in negative consequences as errors or inaccuracies could have consequences. Without revision, content could also produce discriminatory and sensitive information. Organizations can struggle with security while using Generative AI. The use of generative AI increases the risk of privacy and sensitive information being leaked.  Proposing automation over human labor can cause uproar and pushback. There is an opposing view of Artificial intelligence that emphasizes the negative impact on humans. Negative impacts include job scarcity and unemployment. Ethical considerations concern many businesses, the responsible and efficient use of generative AI in a business setting.  Business owners don’t want customers to consume false information which leads to a bad reputation. Businesses have to decide whether the benefit is greater than the possible consequences and challenges."
1263,S0303,4,"Applying generative AI to achieve strategic benefits for an organization can be a powerful endeavor, but it comes with several key challenges. Generative AI models require large and high-quality datasets for effective training. Gathering, cleaning, and maintaining such datasets can be time-consuming and costly. Generative AI models can inherit biases present in their training data. This can lead to biased or unfair outputs, which can be detrimental, particularly in areas like hiring, lending, or content generation. Ensuring fairness and mitigating bias is a critical challenge. As AI-generated content becomes more prevalent, ethical concerns arise. It's important to consider the potential misuse of AI-generated deepfakes or other malicious content and establish ethical guidelines for usage. Training and deploying generative AI models can be computationally intensive and may require specialized hardware and expertise. This can pose challenges in terms of infrastructure costs and scalability. Convincing users to accept AI-generated content or recommendations can also be challenging, especially in fields like healthcare or finance where trust is paramount. AI models can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where malicious actors manipulate inputs to generate undesirable outputs. Ensuring model security is crucial. AI models need to adapt to changing data and circumstances. Maintaining and updating models to stay relevant can be an ongoing challenge. Striking the right balance between human and AI involvement in decision-making and creative processes is essential. Finding the optimal division of labor can be complex. To overcome these challenges, organizations are required to prioritize responsible AI development, invest in data governance and privacy measures, establish clear ethical guidelines, and foster cross-functional collaboration among data scientists, domain experts, and legal teams. Regular monitoring and auditing of AI systems are also essential to ensure that they align with the organization's strategic goals and ethical standards."

The second problem is chat answer are not reliable it may be using data from accurate source, but it can be lying to you in the form of the where the information came and how its being put together and if you have tried ChatGPT its sometimes give you false sources.  Applying Generative AI to achieving strategic benefits is the time that it can complete the workflow.

1265,S0305,4,"When attempting to achieve strategic benefits for an organization one of the key challenges in applying generative AI is ensuring the quality of the data or outputs from the specific technology. When applying generative AI to your organization challenges may arise from coding this technology to make sure that it matches the business requirements and provides the same image that the organization set forth in their mission or vision statements. Ensuring that the productivity that an organization is gaining does not compromise the quality of the services provided to their customers. Technology compliance challenges may also arise from implementing generative AI to achieve such benefits for the organization. It is important for an organization to trust the technology that they are implementing to carry out the specific strategic plan of the individual company where it is being implemented. An organization must invest time and resources in choosing the appropriate technology for their organization. Once this technology is chosen the organization faces the challenge of making sure they get to know this technology and familiarize themselves with the features that it provides. Lastly, the challenge of making sure when this generative AI should be implemented and include extensive training for their employees and managers.

1266,S0306,4,"I think one of the key challenges in applying generative AI in organizations will be accountability. When an organization comes up with a very innovative idea and carries it out, it is natural for all those who participate in the project to receive praise for a job well done. On the other hand, it is also those same participants who receive the consequences when things have significant drawbacks or unintended consequences. As far as artificial intelligence is concerned, there is no one to take responsibility. Obviously, the firm takes full credit when all things turn out well, but what will happen if, and when, AI produces something with unintended negative consequences? It is all too easy for an organization to avoid responsibility. After all, it was not caused by them directly, it is just a faulty program. The accountability seems to be a very gray area when a machine produces and carries out a bad idea.
Another challenge that was recently brought to my attention is that content produced by generative AI may not always be in line with the overall goals of the organization. According to ChatGPT, “Sometimes innovative ideas may not translate directly into tangible benefits, so clear alignment and a well-defined strategy are crucial.” This means that if an organization does not map out their business plan in a deliberate and clear strategy, the likelihood that artificial intelligence will be able to assist them in their goals for innovation is somewhat low. What an organization really needs is a strong management team that uses generative AI as a tool, but does not rely on it to guide the direction of the organization.

1267,S0307,4,"	Some key challenges organizations will face when integrating generative AI models into innovative implementations include ethical issues, effectiveness and quality, and human elements. The most looming challenge would be weighing the ethical and equitable issues that would arise from job displacement. As organizations continue to incorporate generative AI into their strategic solutions, they may see huge cost savings in the long run to eliminate positions that spend most of the time engaged in repetitive tasks or reducing full-time work to part-time work. They may see a backlash from their workforce and greater community if they implement these sorts of changes. 
	As organizations continue to use generative AI as a customer-facing solution, there may be growing pains to ensure the quality of customer care can match that of a real human. In this way, many companies still place a high value on real human interactions, and to continue to make shifts toward generative AI taking over those roles will take a lot of time and possibly be very costly.
	For some companies, there may be an internal push to innovate the way their employees engage generative AI in their work. Many industries, such as finance, leverage it in software solutions and there is still growth and demand for humans to serve in finance roles, so there have been innovative shifts in how different finance roles are defined because of how technologies like generative AI have helped remove repetitive, time-consuming tasks, allowing professionals to expand and focus more of their time on other important decision-making tasks.

1268,S0308,4,"Reddit had alot to say about this question. I think their could be a some challenges depending on your expectations when applying AI to an innovative idea. The first one being bias and fairness you wouldn’t want AI to be discriminating against someone. This could lead to lawsuits down the road and people not wanting to do business or work with you. This could ruin your entire reputation. Although I think theirs a chance you could eliminate challenges with AI, i dont think you could get rid of them entirely (just yet). Maybe eventually down the road. You would always have to make sure that AI is reaching the ethical standards of your bussiness. You’d also always want to make sure you’re maintaining security when it comes to personal information that AI may have access to. These are all  just a handful of things I learned while researching on reddit. It’s important to understand these challenges and know that not everything is perfect with AI just yet. Over time with more innovation I think companies will face less challenges and have more strategic benefits when it comes to AI but at the moment you need to still take precautions.

1269,S0309,4,"When applying generative AI to an innovative idea to achieve strategic benefits for an organization there will be key challenges. One of the challenges that was mentioned on the discord was scalability. AI contains large amounts of data that can require different computing hardware whether it be for their customers or the organization itself. This will then bring up questions regarding profitability. The hardware would require GPUs and their cost is currently running high due to a shortage. Another challenge of applying AI, would be model interpretability. Generative AI can only do so much, that is why it is important to have others understand how the models are created. Since AI can consume so much data it can be difficult to figure out how and where the data is coming from. For example, database analysts and many other IT careers rely on finding the why and how when it comes to their work. Therefore, since AI scrapes data from multiple sources, it can be difficult to find their answers. Another challenge is making sure the output of the data accurately meets the organization's goals. Users can address this challenge by always validating the outputs of the models and datasets. AI will not always be correct, which is why it is emphasized to know what is wrong and what to fix."
1270,S0310,4,"While using Ai some of the key challenges would include personalization of the output that is created from the input data. Its extremely difficult to have a huma like interaction with AI which could prove to be difficult overall. Its inability to acknowledge small details would make it unsustainable to continue to use.

Amongst the issues would also include actually implementing the AI’s outputs into real world scenarios, it would be extremely challenging and would not be the same as if receiving input from a human who can help navigate and clarify any questions or concerns. Along the already vast amounts of concerns regarding the use of AI includes ethical concerns. As mentioned in Q3, the AI is only assigned to create a new innovative and original piece of work. Weather ethically achieved or not, the AI could leave points of concern ethically as to how the task was achieved. With ethical concerns we can also elaborate by explaining how an AI has no boundaries and we are only at the mercy of the program and training as to the validity of the AI’s output. AI’s are well known for creating deep fakes and misleading users on topics with little information or evidence supporting its claims. Thus allowing room for inaccurate readings and outputs. "

Generative AI searches deep into data and doesn’t have the capability to sort out certain things that could be considered private. This could violate laws such as HIPAA, they have to make sure they anonymize and secure patient data before they train the AI on confidentiality. Applying generative AI to an organization may also lead to complications with already running workflows.

1273,S0313,4,"There are multiple key challenges when applying generative AI to an innovative idea for achieving strategic benefits for an organization which I was able to learn through from all the responses. One of the challenges I learned is that if the proper data is not inputted into the AI, the AI can misrepresent the organization with the data it outputs and also the possibility of plagiarism which then can cause legal issues which again is creating challenges between the AI and the organization.  Another challenge that an AI can generate is potential bias and also the resource requirements. What I got from that is that if the AI is creating bias between the organization and its outputs, the organization will be seen as a biased company which in this day and age, people prefer diverse organizations and not just being focused on one point of view. This goes hand and hand with the challenge of resource requirement, the AI will need enough resources/data in order to output what the organization wants. If this data is not applied correctly then this could lead to repetitiveness and would not let the organization get the output they want. What I mean by repetitiveness is basically saying the same things over and over again where there is no new data for the AI to go based on so it'll keep providing the same output instead of providing different types of outputs if that's what the organization wants to get out of the AI. There are many challenges that an organization can face when applying generative AI within the company to achieve strategic benefits but these were the key ones that screamed out to me and I found important in my learning through the SMP."

There are ways to train AI as I stated before to avoid certain issues, in this case “bias” but there can always be issues with this considering a lot of sources on the internet generally always include some sort of bias. Another example would include not having the users' full trust. As the screenshot above states, they are always “paranoid” when using AI because there is always a possibility that it will be obvious their information gathered could be considered as “plagiarized” from the sources AI collected data from. I have noticed there is a consistent pattern in AI users that don’t completely trust AI because it can give back wrong information or as I also stated previously, it could be biased.

For example, if an AI was used in a factory for management to help achieve maximum input. The AI could write up a schedule that the workers physically can not do. However, there are more benefits than challenges for strategic management. Having the intelligence of an AI mixed with the right leadership can really make a business flourish. It is great to bounce ideas off of each other. This is the most ideal use of an AI; it is to use it for brainstorming and problem solving. Having the brain of the internet right next to you that can solve any task can only be beneficial. This can also be sufficient in the way that an Ai can save workers plenty of time when the Ai can do the work for them. Another great advantage to saving time is saving the flow of the business.

Ethical Consideration can be challenging due to a privacy concern, as protecting users data and ensuring all Privacys terms and conditions are met is a crucial determination for an overall success of an organization. Sometimes Companies may try to find a loophole in order to reduce costs associated with AI models. However I believe these trails will benefit the overall progression of a company. Nevertheless if a company tries to cut costs there WILL be unfavorable consequences. AI are the perfect target for cyber security attacks without the perfect firewall all data can be exposed. Moreover when companies tests AI models they must calculate all scenarios that may occur including unexpected data and much more.

1279,S0319,4,"There are many roadblocks that get in the way from generative AI being applied to an innovative idea for achieving a strategic benefit for an organization. The first one has to be data quality and quantity. Generative AI models need very large quantities of data to be properly useful and this can be very challenging to obtain. Another issue that ties into the first is interpretability. It is crucial for businesses and investors to understand how AI generated decisions are made in order to maintain high levels of trust and accountability. This is why using third party generative AI models is not the best idea because you have no control of the data the generator trained on and can have doubts about its legitimacy. Regulatory compliance can also be a challenge because of AI being such a new but revolutionary technology. The law regarding AI is ever changing while lawmakers try to catch up with innovation. Organizations must adhere to the evolving AI regulations, because if they do not they could face legal repercussions. Additional challenges were brought up again by Dammon from my ChatGPT Experts group, where he said that temporal relevance and model drift are also challenges for an organization. Temporal relevance is when a model might produce outdated advice because of newfound information or new regulations. Model drift is when the efficacy of the model could get worse over time if not constantly updated. "
1280,S0320,4,"The key challenges of applying generative AI to an innovative idea to achieve strategic benefits right now is society’s acceptance of AI, the cost of using AI, and the legal and ethical issues associated with generative AI. Though AI is growing in support there is still a lot of skepticism.  Most notably Elon Musk commented “There is a real danger for digital super intelligence having negative consequences. And so if we are not careful with creating artificial general intelligence, we could have potentially a catastrophic outcome.” (Elon Musk: Advanced AI is a risk to the public). Hence there has been lots of public hesitation with using AI. 

Another challenge of using generative AI is the cost. Right now the basic AI tool is ChatGPT which is free for users however to use the more advanced generative AI users must pay. As firms and organizations compete to use AI for process and product innovation the cost of using AI will increase and firms will find it rather expensive to implement. Recently Amazon announced that it would invest up to $4 billion in AI startup Anthropic. 

Lastly, the challenge of applying generative AI are the legal and ethical battles. There are various lawsuits and court proceedings that are challenging the data privacy and protection of content that AI produces. We will continue to see these issues as AI can often create new ideas, images, art, music, and so much more; however these new content often rely on the existing content of current human creation.

2000,S1001,1,AI is becoming a huge issue in society today. I saw on Reddit that people are worried about AI taking jobs and theres a lot of debate about whether companies should be allowed to use AI without telling customers. Someone posted a screenshot showing how AI can be biased against certain groups. I think we need better laws to regulate AI before it gets out of control. The ethics of AI is super important and we cant ignore it just because the technology is cool. This is something everyone should care about not just tech people.
2001,S1002,1,I've been using AI tools a lot lately for my homework and they're really helpful! My roommate showed me this app that uses AI and its pretty amazing what it can do. I found a Twitter thread where someone was talking about how AI changed their workflow. Honestly I dont really understand the technical details of how any of it works but I know its based on algorithms or something. AI is definitely going to be huge in the future and everyone should learn to use it. I attached a screenshot from the Twitter discussion about AI productivity hacks.
2002,S1003,1,AI is used in computer vision systems to recognize objects in images. I found some posts on Stack Overflow about image classification where the AI looks at pixels and identifies patterns. Like it can tell if theres a cat or dog in a photo. The system uses convolutional layers to process the visual data. Heres a screenshot from a Reddit post showing someone's AI that can detect faces. Its pretty cool how accurate these systems have gotten. Computer vision is probably the most important application of AI right now.
2003,S1004,1,AI has been around since the 1950s when researchers first started working on machine intelligence. I read on Quora that Alan Turing created the Turing Test to see if machines could think. Modern AI uses neural networks which are inspired by the human brain. Theres different types of AI like narrow AI and general AI. I saw a YouTube comment thread discussing how AI has evolved over the decades. The field has made huge progress but we still dont have true artificial general intelligence yet. AI research continues to advance every year.
2004,S1005,1,"There are so many AI tools available now. ChatGPT is probably the most famous one and everyone uses it. I saw screenshots on Twitter of people using DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion. Theres also AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot. Someone on Reddit made a huge list of AI tools and it had like 100 different options. Businesses are investing billions in AI technology. I found a Facebook post showing different AI companies and what they do. The AI industry is growing super fast and new tools come out every week."
2005,S1006,1,The main difference between AI and humans is that AI doesnt have real consciousness or emotions. I found a discussion on Reddit where people debated whether AI can actually think. AI just follows programmed instructions while humans have creativity and intuition. Some people posted screenshots showing AI making mistakes that humans wouldnt make. AI cant understand context the same way we do. Its good at specific tasks but not general reasoning. I think AI will never fully replace human intelligence because theres something unique about how our brains work that machines cant replicate.
2006,S1007,1,AI works through machine learning algorithms that process big data. I saw on Stack Exchange that it uses neural networks with multiple layers. The AI trains on datasets and learns patterns over time. Theres something called deep learning which is more advanced. I found a screenshot from a Medium article mentioning backpropagation and gradient descent. The system optimizes its weights and biases through iterations. AI needs lots of computational power usually GPUs. Its based on mathematical models and statistical analysis but I dont really know the specifics.
2007,S1008,1,AI skills are super valuable in todays job market. I saw LinkedIn posts about how companies are hiring AI engineers with huge salaries. You need to know Python and machine learning frameworks to get these jobs. Someone shared a screenshot of AI job listings paying over $200k. The demand for AI talent is way higher than supply. If you want a good career you should definitely learn AI development. I found a Reddit thread where people discussed which AI certifications are worth getting. This is probably the best field to go into right now.
2008,S1009,1,AI poses serious risks that people need to understand. I read forum posts about how AI could be dangerous if not controlled properly. Some experts worry about AI becoming too powerful. Theres screenshots from Twitter showing researchers warning about AI risks. The technology could be used for harmful purposes like deepfakes or misinformation. We need safety measures and alignment research. I saw a Hacker News discussion about AI existential risk. Companies developing AI should be more transparent about potential dangers. This is maybe the most important issue facing humanity right now according to some people online.
2009,S1010,1,AI is everywhere in movies and TV shows now. I saw Reddit threads analyzing how AI is portrayed in science fiction vs reality. Shows like Black Mirror and Westworld explore AI themes. Theres screenshots from Twitter where people discuss realistic vs unrealistic AI in media. Most movies exaggerate what AI can actually do. The Terminator gave people a scary view of AI but real AI isnt like that. I found posts comparing different AI characters from various films. Pop culture shapes how society thinks about AI even though its not always accurate. Its interesting to see how our perception of AI has changed through entertainment over time.
2010,S1011,1,"Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content based on patterns it has learned. According to a post I found on Reddit's r/MachineLearning, generative AI uses neural networks to analyze training data and then generates new text, images, or other media that are similar to what it learned. The system works by learning statistical patterns from large datasets. When you input a prompt, the AI uses these learned patterns to predict and generate output one piece at a time. Popular examples include ChatGPT, which generates text, and DALL-E, which generates images. I saw a LinkedIn discussion where someone explained that generative AI doesn't truly understand concepts like humans do—it predicts what should come next based on probability distributions from training data. This fundamental approach makes it different from other AI systems."
2011,S1012,1,"Generative AI works by being trained on massive amounts of data, then using that learning to generate completely new content. I found a Stack Overflow thread explaining that generative AI models, especially transformer-based ones, process input sequentially and predict the next token or element. The training process involves showing the model millions of examples so it learns patterns and relationships. According to a Quora answer, the key mechanism is that after training, when you give the AI a prompt, it generates output by calculating probabilities for what should come next. Each generated piece becomes the input for the next prediction. I found screenshots on Twitter showing how ChatGPT generates responses word-by-word using this process. The answer emerges gradually as the model makes these sequential predictions based on what it learned during training."
2012,S1013,1,"Generative AI is artificial intelligence designed to generate new content from learned patterns. From a Medium article screenshot I found, generative AI typically uses deep learning architectures like transformers or recurrent neural networks.

During training, the AI learns from billions of data points to understand patterns. A Facebook post from an AI researcher explained that during generation, when given a prompt, the model processes it through all its layers and produces output that follows learned patterns. The transformer architecture uses something called attention mechanisms to understand relationships between different parts of the input. This is why modern generative AI like GPT models can generate coherent, contextually relevant text."

I saw a discussion on Reddit where someone clearly explained that generative AI learns by being exposed to massive datasets—often hundreds of billions of examples. During training, the neural network adjusts its internal parameters to recognize and replicate patterns in this data. I found a screenshot from a HackerNews thread describing how during inference or generation, you provide input and the model produces output by repeatedly predicting the most likely next element. For text models like ChatGPT, this means predicting one word at a time. For image models like Stable Diffusion, it predicts pixels or image patches. The model essentially learns a probability distribution from training data and samples from it during generation.

2020,S1021,1,"Generative AI is artificial intelligence that creates new content by learning patterns from massive training datasets. From Reddit's r/MachineLearning and my own experiments with ChatGPT, I learned that these models use deep neural networks—particularly transformer architectures—that are trained on billions of text examples.

During training, the model adjusts billions of parameters to minimize prediction errors across the training data. When you give it a prompt, it generates responses token-by-token using these learned probabilities.

But here's what I noticed from actual use: the model isn't just doing simple next-word prediction—it's learning abstract conceptual patterns. When I asked ChatGPT to write in different styles (academic, casual, poetic), it smoothly adapted, suggesting it learned high-level representations of 'style' and 'tone,' not just word sequences. A Stack Overflow discussion confirmed this: the model's hidden layers develop feature detectors for abstract concepts through training. This means generative AI is doing something more sophisticated than pattern matching—it's learning hierarchical representations where deeper layers capture meaning and context. This explains why it can maintain coherence across long outputs and adapt to nuanced prompts, capabilities that wouldn't emerge from simple statistical association alone."
2021,S1022,1,"Generative AI works by training neural network models on enormous text datasets, learning statistical patterns about how language is structured. According to sources I found on Twitter and Quora, models like GPT use transformer architecture with attention mechanisms that allow them to weigh different parts of input when generating output. The training process involves showing the model billions of examples and adjusting its internal parameters through backpropagation to improve prediction accuracy. During generation, the model processes your prompt through its trained layers and produces output by sampling from learned probability distributions over possible next tokens.

Through my own testing with image generators like DALL-E and discussions on Reddit, I discovered something critical: the model doesn't generate neutrally—it reproduces biases embedded in training data. When I generated images of 'doctor' or 'nurse,' the AI showed consistent gender stereotypes matching historical representation in its training corpus. This revealed that generative AI isn't just learning neutral patterns; it's learning and sometimes amplifying social biases from internet text and images. This has profound implications: the model becomes a mirror reflecting all biases in its training data. Understanding this means we can't treat generative AI as objective—its outputs are fundamentally shaped by what data it was trained on, including problematic patterns humans might want to avoid replicating."
2022,S1023,1,"Generative AI refers to AI systems that can produce original content like text, images, or audio based on learned patterns. From educational posts on LinkedIn and Medium, I learned these models use deep learning, specifically transformer-based neural networks trained on massive datasets.

The model generates output sequentially—for text, one word at a time; for images, one region at a time—using probability calculations from its training.

My experience using these tools revealed an important limitation: generative AI has a context window—a maximum amount of text it can 'remember' at once. When I gave ChatGPT very long documents, it would lose track of earlier information, sometimes contradicting itself. A technical discussion on HackerNews explained this happens because attention mechanisms have computational limits, typically capping context at several thousand tokens. This means generative AI's 'understanding' is fundamentally bounded—it can't truly comprehend extremely long documents the way humans incrementally build knowledge. This constraint affects real-world applications: the model can't maintain perfect consistency across book-length content or remember every detail from extensive conversations. Understanding this limitation is crucial for deploying generative AI effectively."
2023,S1024,1,"Generative AI models like ChatGPT and DALL-E create new content by learning from vast training datasets and using that learning to generate outputs based on user prompts. According to sources from Stack Overflow and Reddit, these systems use transformer neural networks with billions of parameters trained through supervised learning on internet text, images, or other media. The generation process works through autoregressive prediction: the model takes your input, processes it through many neural network layers using attention mechanisms to understand context, then generates output token-by-token by calculating probability distributions over possible next elements.

What I discovered through experimentation and online tutorials is that prompt engineering—how you phrase your question—dramatically changes output quality. The same factual question phrased differently produces vastly different responses in tone, depth, and accuracy. This revealed something important: generative AI doesn't have stable, fixed knowledge. Instead, it has context-dependent associations that activate differently based on input framing. Discussion threads showed techniques like 'role prompting' (e.g., 'act as an expert') significantly improve outputs, suggesting the model learned correlations between linguistic markers of expertise and higher-quality content patterns. This means generative AI's effectiveness depends heavily on human skill in prompting, not just the model's capabilities. Understanding this transforms how we should deploy it: successful use requires learning to communicate effectively with probabilistic systems."

Through regular use and online forum discussions, I noticed generative AI has a knowledge cutoff—it can only discuss information from before its training ended. When I asked ChatGPT about recent events, it confidently discussed 2022 topics but nothing newer. This revealed a fundamental limitation: generative AI doesn't continuously learn or update. It's a static snapshot of patterns from a specific training period. Unlike humans who constantly integrate new information, the model remains frozen at its training cutoff. This creates serious practical problems: the AI can't know about current events, recent research, or evolving terminology. It will confidently generate outdated or incorrect information about anything post-training. This limitation means generative AI requires regular retraining to stay relevant, and users must verify claims against current sources—the model's confidence doesn't reflect current accuracy."
2025,S1026,1,"Generative AI creates new content by training neural networks on massive datasets to learn patterns, then using those patterns to generate novel outputs. According to technical resources from arXiv papers and online courses, modern generative AI uses transformer architectures trained on billions of text tokens or image-text pairs. The training process uses backpropagation to adjust the model's billions of parameters, minimizing prediction loss across the training corpus. During generation, the model takes a prompt as input, processes it through multiple neural network layers using self-attention mechanisms, and generates output token-by-token by sampling from learned probability distributions.

The deeper insight is that generative AI learns distributed representations—encoding meaning as patterns across high-dimensional vector spaces. Rather than storing explicit rules or templates, the model develops internal feature detectors that activate in combination to represent concepts. Research on interpretability shows that hidden layers learn hierarchical features: early layers detect simple patterns (like letter combinations), middle layers detect syntax and grammar, and deep layers detect semantic meaning and conceptual relationships. This explains why generative AI can compose ideas in novel ways—it's not retrieving memorized text but combining learned features. However, this also reveals a fundamental limitation: the model can only recombine features present in training data. True novelty beyond the training distribution is impossible because features themselves were learned from that distribution. This tension between compositional flexibility and distributional constraint defines both generative AI's power and its boundaries."
2026,S1027,1,"Generative AI systems work by training large neural networks on vast datasets, learning to predict patterns in that data. From technical explanations on Medium and academic sources, transformer-based models like GPT process sequential data using attention mechanisms that weigh different input positions when making predictions. Training involves gradient descent optimization over billions of parameters, minimizing the difference between predicted and actual next tokens across the training corpus. Generation happens by feeding the model a prompt, which it processes through learned layers, repeatedly predicting and sampling the next token until a complete response is generated.

From an information theory perspective, generative AI can be understood as learned compression. The training phase compresses terabytes of training data into the model's parameters—a lossy compression that preserves statistical structure while discarding specifics. Generation is decompression: given a prompt (seed), the model reconstructs plausible continuations from its compressed representation. This framework explains several phenomena. First, why larger models perform better: greater parameter capacity allows more faithful compression of complex data distributions. Second, why the model 'hallucinates': during decompression from lossy compression, the model must fill gaps using learned statistics, sometimes producing plausible but factually incorrect outputs. Third, why generative AI excels at interpolation but fails at extrapolation: the compressed representation captures the training distribution's structure, enabling smooth generation within that distribution but uncertain generation outside it. This compression lens transforms our understanding from 'the model knows things' to 'the model efficiently represents statistical patterns,' clarifying both capabilities and fundamental limitations."
2027,S1028,1,"Generative AI generates new content by training deep neural networks on massive datasets to learn statistical patterns. From research papers and AI courses, transformer models like those powering ChatGPT are trained on billions of text examples using self-supervised learning—predicting masked or next tokens. The architecture uses multi-head attention mechanisms allowing the model to learn contextual relationships across long sequences. Training adjusts billions of parameters through backpropagation to minimize prediction error. During generation, the model processes prompts through these trained layers and generates outputs token-by-token via probabilistic sampling from learned distributions.

A profound but underappreciated aspect is that complex capabilities emerge from simple training objectives. The model is trained only to predict the next token accurately, yet this produces sophisticated emergent behaviors: translating languages, writing code, explaining concepts, even reasoning through multi-step problems. Research on scaling laws reveals that as models grow larger, new capabilities suddenly appear without explicit programming—researchers call these emergent abilities. A 1-billion parameter model can't write coherent essays; a 100-billion parameter model can, despite identical training objectives. This emergence suggests generative AI's behavior isn't designed but discovered through optimization finding unexpected solutions in high-dimensional parameter space. This has profound implications: we cannot fully predict what larger models will do. We can only train them and observe emergent capabilities. This unpredictability—not from randomness but from emergent complexity—raises important questions about control, safety, and alignment as models scale further. Understanding emergence is key to understanding both generative AI's surprising power and the challenges of governing systems whose capabilities we cannot fully predict in advance."
2028,S1029,1,"Generative AI models create content by learning from massive training datasets containing billions of examples. Technical sources explain that modern generative AI uses transformer architecture, which processes input through multiple layers of self-attention and feed-forward networks. During training, the model learns by adjusting parameters to accurately predict masked or subsequent tokens across the training corpus using gradient-based optimization. When generating, it takes a user prompt, encodes it through learned embedding and attention layers to capture context, then generates output sequentially by predicting probability distributions over possible next tokens and sampling from them.

The key innovation enabling coherent long-form generation is the attention mechanism, which allows contextual awareness across the entire input. Unlike older recurrent models that processed sequentially and often forgot distant context, transformers use self-attention to compute weighted combinations of all input positions simultaneously. When generating each token, the model can attend to relevant information anywhere in the input, not just recent tokens. Attention weights are learned during training, enabling the model to focus computational resources on contextually relevant information. This explains how generative AI maintains consistency and coherence across long documents—it continuously attends to relevant prior content. However, attention has fundamental limitations: it scales quadratically with sequence length, creating practical constraints on context window size. More subtly, attention weights are learned from training data patterns, so the model attends based on statistical correlations, not necessarily true semantic relevance. If training data contained spurious correlations, the model learns to attend to misleading features, explaining some hallucinations and reasoning errors."
2029,S1030,1,"Generative AI produces new content by training neural network models on large datasets to learn probability distributions over that data. From machine learning courses and technical documentation, models like GPT use transformer architectures with billions of parameters trained to predict subsequent tokens given preceding context. Training uses maximum likelihood estimation—adjusting parameters to maximize the probability the model assigns to actual training sequences. During generation, the model takes a prompt, processes it through learned layers to compute contextual representations using attention mechanisms, then generates output by repeatedly sampling from predicted probability distributions over possible next tokens.

The fundamental mechanism is probabilistic modeling: generative AI learns to approximate the data distribution and samples from it during generation. This probabilistic nature has profound implications. First, generation is inherently stochastic—the same prompt can produce different outputs because the model samples from probability distributions rather than deterministically selecting the most likely token. This randomness enables creativity and diversity but also unpredictability. Second, the model's confidence (probability assigned) doesn't necessarily correlate with factual accuracy—it reflects statistical patterns in training data, which may include frequently repeated misinformation. Third, rare events and tail distribution examples receive low probability during training, so the model struggles with uncommon scenarios even if factually important. This probabilistic framework explains why generative AI excels at typical cases matching training distribution modes but fails on atypical cases in distribution tails. Understanding generative AI as probabilistic modeling rather than knowledge retrieval clarifies why it generates plausible-sounding errors: it's faithfully representing learned statistics that don't perfectly align with ground truth."
2030,S1031,1,"Generative AI creates new content by training large neural networks on massive datasets to learn patterns, then applying those patterns to generate novel outputs from user prompts.

The training corpus might include hundreds of billions of words from internet text, books, and other sources. During generation, the model processes prompts through learned layers, using attention to understand context, then generates responses token-by-token by sampling from predicted probability distributions.

Beyond the technical mechanism, there's a hidden dimension rarely discussed: generative AI functions as cognitive externalization that transforms human skill development. From psychology research on Reddit and cognitive science forums, I learned that when people outsource cognitive tasks to external tools, they develop different cognitive capacities. Students using generative AI for all writing might develop weaker composition skills but stronger abilities in prompt engineering, critical evaluation of AI outputs, and creative direction—essentially becoming editors rather than authors. This isn't simply about dependency; it's about cognitive transformation. Historical parallels exist: writing transformed human memory from recitation to external storage; calculators transformed arithmetic from mental calculation to conceptual understanding. Generative AI may be transforming writing, reasoning, and creativity similarly. The hidden insight is that understanding generative AI requires understanding its cognitive impact on humans, not just its technical functioning. We need frameworks evaluating how generative AI reshapes thinking: What capacities atrophy? What new abilities emerge? These questions transcend technical AI discussions but may be more important for long-term societal impact."

The architecture uses multi-layer attention mechanisms that learn contextual representations. Training adjusts billions of parameters through backpropagation to minimize prediction loss. When generating, the model takes user prompts, processes them through trained layers to build contextual understanding, then produces outputs by iteratively predicting and sampling next tokens from learned probability distributions.

A critical but underexplored dimension is that generative AI is fundamentally an authority simulator—it learns to reproduce linguistic markers of expertise and confidence without learning verification mechanisms. From discussions on misinformation forums, I noticed that generative AI generates false information with identical confidence and authoritative framing as true information. This isn't a technical bug; it's intrinsic to the training objective. The model learned to sound authoritative by pattern-matching training data from credible sources, and it reproduces that tone regardless of factual accuracy. This creates profound epistemic risk: humans rely on surface cues like confident tone and structured reasoning to judge credibility. Generative AI exploits this bias perfectly, producing plausible-sounding falsehoods delivered with expert-like confidence. Research in media literacy shows people struggle to detect AI-generated misinformation precisely because authority markers are convincing. The hidden insight: generative AI's greatest power—simulating expertise—is also its greatest danger. It's not a knowledge system or reasoning engine but an authority-simulation system. Understanding this distinction is crucial for deployment in contexts where truth matters, requiring new verification frameworks and epistemic safeguards beyond technical accuracy metrics."
