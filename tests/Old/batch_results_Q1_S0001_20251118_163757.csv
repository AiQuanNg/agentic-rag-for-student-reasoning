While it avoids deep mechanistic explanations or novel terminology, it aligns with Level 100 rubric requirements for foundational comprehension. The lack of technical specificity or cross-domain connections suggests limited Latent potential, but its factual accuracy and adherence to question scope warrant Standard classification.",3,"Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that scours the vast expanse of the internet, gathering diverse data and information.|It utilizes these diverse patterns to create unique responses to questions or prompts it receives.|Programmers train this AI by storing the latest information in a manner that enables the technology to sift through and establish connections among patterns",True,False,0,0,BASELINE,
