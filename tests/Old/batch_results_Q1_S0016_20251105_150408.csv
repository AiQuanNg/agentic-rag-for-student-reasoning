While it includes some non-standard terms like 'spews out' and 'cognitive mimicry', the response remains focused on basic 'What' aspects of generative AI rather than exploring deeper mechanisms or implications. The high extraction confidence (0.92) and complete coverage of fundamental themes confirm this is a Standard-level answer.",3,"Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that generates or creates new information based on old information that it already knows and has and combines it with everything, and then it spews out all the new information.|The type of content this generative AI can create can range from text, images, audio, and even videos just through the use of its generative models.|The generative AI can depict, create, and understand all the data that it has ever presented making it way faster, and as knowledgeable as an actual human being.",True,False,0,0,BASELINE,
