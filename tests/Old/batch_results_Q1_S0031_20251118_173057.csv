While it uses relevant terminology ('generative', 'technological system') and addresses the question's surface requirements, it fails to elaborate on *how* systems achieve this (e.g., machine learning models, training data, text-to-creation pipelines). The extractor's findings show only surface-level technical themes and novel phrasing ('quickly inputting') without substantive analysis, aligning with Standard rubric expectations for fundamentals questions. No Off-Topic signals were detected despite the 0.85 confidence score, as the content remains relevant to the fundamentals topic.",1,Generative AI allows users to generate unique content quickly by a user simply inputting any information into a technological system.,False,False,0,0,BASELINE,
