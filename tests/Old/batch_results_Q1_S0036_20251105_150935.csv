While meeting basic understanding criteria, it shows critical engagement with model learning processes and technical implementation details that exceed surface-level recall. The classification confidence matches the Extractor's 0.85 confidence.",2,"It works by being trained with large amounts of pre-existing data... neural networks, and mathematical models to recognize patterns from words in the data.|This method of fine-tuning... called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback.",True,False,0,0,BASELINE,

While it mentions different model types, the descriptions focus on fundamental concepts rather than deeper innovations. The comparison to an artist and the 'infancy' acknowledgment appropriately frame the explanation within basic understanding boundaries.",3,"Generative AI refers to an artificial intelligence that uses its data that it already knows to create new and original content. It could be compared to an artist in the world of computers.|The AI is shown examples of information and data and as it continues to see more and more examples, it can learn patterns and generate new images, texts, or sounds.|This type of AI technology seems to have been doing well in applications of different fields such as art, design, scientific research, and entertainment.",True,False,0,0,BASELINE,

It uses standard terminology (generator, mimic) without novel concepts and provides examples (art, news) without explaining *how* the technology achieves this. This aligns with the Standard rubric level 100% which requires accurate definitions and descriptions without requiring novel reasoning or mechanism explanation.",2,"Generative AI, is AI that’s designed to create content that closely mimics human-generated content.|The generator or AI, is always trying to use information to come close to what a human would make.",True,False,0,0,BASELINE,

While grounded in fundamentals, it adds analytical depth through architectural reasoning about training methodology.",3,"Generative AI, stands distinctively different from many other AI systems, particularly in the way it uses data.|The primary objective of this intensive selection process is to help the AI understand, recognize, and decipher intricate patterns and relationships within the data.|For instance, consider platforms like ChatGPT. When a user inputs a prompt or question, the AI doesn't rush to collect fresh data from the internet or databases. Instead, it dives into its pre-trained understanding, tapping into the patterns and relationships it has already learned.",False,True,2,2,BASELINE,
