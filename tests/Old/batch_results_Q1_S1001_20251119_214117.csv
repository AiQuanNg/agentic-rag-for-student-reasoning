However, it lacks explanation of technical fundamentals (e.g., neural networks, training data) and does not use specific technical terminology (e.g., foundation models, diffusion), which would elevate it to LATENT. The response aligns with basic rubric expectations for fundamentals (STANDARD) but falls short of deeper analysis required for LATENT.",4,AI is becoming a huge issue in society today|debate about whether companies should be allowed to use AI without telling customers|need better laws to regulate AI before it gets out of control|ethics of AI is super important,False,True,0,0,BASELINE,

The response contains surface-level descriptions of applications (homework help, productivity hacks) without explaining underlying principles like neural networks, training data, or token generation. While the student acknowledges AI's future impact, this remains a surface-level prediction rather than analysis of implementation challenges or systemic implications. The rubric alignment shows basic terminology recognition (technology application level) but no evidence of mechanism explanation required for latent classification.",2,Honestly I dont really understand the technical details of how any of it works but I know its based on algorithms or something|AI is definitely going to be huge in the future and everyone should learn to use it,False,True,0,0,BASELINE,

It demonstrates basic understanding of computer vision applications but does not explore deeper mechanisms of generative AI or engage in critical analysis. The response aligns with Level 100 rubric criteria through factual accuracy and application examples, but lacks synthesis or evaluation that would indicate Latent-level reasoning.",3,AI is used in computer vision systems to recognize objects in images|Heres a screenshot from a Reddit post showing someone's AI that can detect faces|Computer vision is probably the most important application of AI right now,True,False,0,0,BASELINE,

While the answer includes contextual sources (Quora, YouTube) and evolutionary context, these primarily support basic definitions rather than demonstrating analysis. No evidence of mechanistic explanation beyond naming neural networks as inspiration. Rubric alignment confirms standard-level signals (technical terminology, factual accuracy) outweigh latent indicators.",0,,True,False,0,0,BASELINE,
