While partially meeting 100% rubric criteria, it introduces novel concepts like emotional/intuitive intelligence that go beyond basic definitions.",4,AI doesnt have real consciousness or emotions|AI just follows programmed instructions|AI making mistakes that humans wouldnt make|AI will never fully replace human intelligence,False,True,2,1,BASELINE,

While containing fundamental concepts, the depth extends beyond basic definitions to include advanced technical processes.",6,AI works through machine learning algorithms that process big data. I saw on Stack Exchange that it uses neural networks with multiple layers.|The AI trains on datasets and learns patterns over time. Theres something called deep learning which is more advanced.|I found a screenshot from a Medium article mentioning backpropagation and gradient descent. The system optimizes its weights and biases through iterations.|AI needs lots of computational power usually GPUs. Its based on mathematical models and statistical analysis but I dont really know the specifics.|Theres something called deep learning which is more advanced.|The system optimizes its weights and biases through iterations.,True,False,0,0,BASELINE,

The response connects technical learning (Python, frameworks) to job market realities (high salaries, workforce shortages), showing analysis of systemic factors beyond basic recall. Though it doesn't discuss generative AI's technical mechanisms, this practical perspective reveals emerging expertise about AI's societal role and labor implications.",5,AI skills are super valuable in todays job market.|Someone shared a screenshot of AI job listings paying over $200k.|The demand for AI talent is way higher than supply.|This is probably the best field to go into now.|This is probably the best field to go into right now.,True,False,0,0,BASELINE,

While it mentions technical aspects (deepfakes, misinformation), the answer primarily explores broader ethical implications and consequences rather than explaining generative AI mechanisms. The reference to alignment research and transparency requirements shows some analytical thinking, and the Hacker News discussion context suggests critical evaluation of expert perspectives. However, the answer remains surface-level in its risk enumeration without explaining HOW generative AI systems could be exploited technically.",0,,False,True,1,0,BASELINE,

It aligns with level_50 rubric criteria by including accurate examples without demonstrating comprehensive understanding or critical analysis. The latent signals (e.g., societal perception) are noted but not advanced beyond recognition of surface patterns.",4,AI is everywhere in movies and TV shows now|Black Mirror and Westworld explore AI themes|Most movies exaggerate what AI can actually do|Pop culture shapes how society thinks about AI,False,True,0,0,BASELINE,
