The Stack Overflow reference and discussion of emergent adaptation capabilities further strengthen LATENT classification.",6,"Generative AI ... text examples|models use deep neural networks—particularly transformer architectures—that are trained on billions of text examples|the model adjusts billions of parameters to minimize prediction errors|When you give it a prompt, it generates responses token-by-token using these learned probabilities|it's learning abstract conceptual patterns|experimented with ChatGPT ... write in different styles (academic, casual, poetic)",False,False,3,0,BASELINE,

While it includes some deeper insights about prompt engineering's impact, the primary focus remains on explaining *what* happens (fundamental processes) rather than emphasizing systemic implications or novel theoretical insights.
