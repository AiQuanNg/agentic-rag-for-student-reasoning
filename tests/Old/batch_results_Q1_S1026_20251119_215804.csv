While containing STANDARD-level terminology (neural networks, transformers), it goes beyond description to explain *how* these components work together. The highest confidence threshold applies due to explicit reference to research (arXiv), integration of technical and theoretical concepts, and systemic pattern recognition about model capabilities/limitations.",5,"Generative AI creates new content by training neural networks on massive datasets...|The model learns distributed representations—encoding meaning as patterns...|This tension between compositional flexibility and distributional constraint defines both generative AI's power and its boundaries.|However, this also reveals a fundamental limitation: the model can only recombine features present in training data.|According to technical resources from arXiv papers and online courses,",True,False,0,0,BASELINE,

The answer exceeds surface-level facts to explain *why* and *how*, aligning with rubric signal C (critical engagement) and D (evidence).

While exceeding surface-level fundamentals, this depth aligns with Latent criteria for Question Goal #1 (basics), as the foundational mechanisms are clearly explained with innovation.

While covering required terminology like 'transformer architecture', the response excels in explaining *how* attention weights work, their training implications, and connects to real-world issues like hallucinations through statistical correlations. This aligns with Rubric Level 100 requirements. The high confidence stems from multiple latent signals: theory-practice bridges (masked token prediction), systemic analysis (sequence length constraints), and critique through pattern recognition (spurious correlations).
