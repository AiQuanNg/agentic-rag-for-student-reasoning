6,"When I searched the question “What is generative AI and how does it work?” on Reddit, I found a post I assume to be from another student in class. Nonetheless, its exactly what I needed. Generative AI is a form of artificial intelligence that utilizes generative models to produce a wide range of content. The content produced by these generative models consist of text, images, music, audio, and videos. Generative models are machine learning models that are trained to collect data and patterns of existing content relevant to the content one wishes to produce. Using the collected data/patterns, the machine will populate new content containing similar characteristics. I see it as if you asked a kid to draw a picture of a car. In this scenario, the kid would represent the generative model, and the cars they have seen before would represent the data collection aspect of generative ai. Rather than drawing a car from a specific manufacture, they would likely draw wheels and a body structure. They would draw the picture using their perception of what a car should look like based on the cars they have seen in the past. With that being said, there are different types of generative models that come with their own advantages/disadvantages.

7,"After research through my OKC, reddit, I learned many things about generative AI, what it is, how it is used, and how it works. Overall, generative AI, or generative artificial intelligence, is a technology that uses accessible “pre-existing datasets” to create media such as text and images. These generative AIs, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other platforms, simulate neural networks to create realistic and accurate content for users. The main difference between generative AI and simple artificial intelligence is that simple AI is used to perform basic tasks that usually require human action/intervention, while generative AI focuses on the creation of media tailored to humans in a similar way that simple AI does. The term “simple AI” is being used in this context of the basic understanding we have on the broad focus of the field of computer science based on creating systems that usually tend to require human intelligence for proper use. During the creation and testing of generative AI, human developers process these data sets through these platforms to ultimately teach human-like patterns and relationship patterns, which can create these neural networks that can generate realistic content. In a way, we are teaching the generative AI to view information in a human way, so that the content that is generated in a more receptive way to humans. It is programmed to create content that it believes we
would accept as true the most based on data and information that it draws from. This process of making relevant and receptive information by generative AI involves taking previously input information and patterns to create relevant and situationally accurate media. Overall, generative AI creates media for human use, based on data and is contextually relevant due to constant machine learning.

From my research I found a couple article posted on the r/artificial subreddit that allowed me to learn a lot more about how Generative AI works and what it is, these articles were a great resource for me, here are some of my findings:  

Generative AI is also called an LLM, which stands for language-learning-model - these are models that are trained with data. They are sometimes described as a very good “autocomplete” - which is a technology we are more than likely familiar with on our phones where the keyboard tends to predict what our next word is going to be. These LLMs are designed to take input, tokenize keywords that are within your input, and then expand it in a way that would be similar or organic like a human would articulate it. 

ChatGPT is also a generative AI chatbot that popularized the concept but it is not the first. ELIZA which was a chatbot created in 1961 by a scientist named Joseph Weizenbaum was the first of its kind. So while it may seem like ChatGPT is a pioneer of generative AI, it is the result of decades of work. Technological improvements are also a huge part of the reason why generative AI is booming, since AI models and algorithms typically require strong processing capabilities, they were not as common until recently, where even our phones are as powerful as some of the best computers that money could buy just ten years ago.

18,"Generative AI, a powerful branch of artificial intelligence, is a technology
designed to create diverse forms of content, spanning text, imagery, audio, and synthetic
data (Google Cloud Tech). Its fundamental objective is to emulate human-like thinking
and behavior, striving to replicate perceived human thought or action. Moreover,
generative AI operates within the broader framework of deep learning, which includes
neural networks capable of processing both labeled and unlabeled data through various
techniques, including supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised (Google Cloud
Tech).
In contrast to its counterpart, discriminative AI, which focuses on classifying or
predicting labels from given data, generative AI is geared towards generating entirely
new content and data instances. By harnessing generative models, AI systems can learn
patterns and relationships within data, subsequently applying this knowledge to produce
original content. Furthermore, generative AI has a variety of model types, each
specializing in different creative processes. These models include text-to-image, text-to-
video, text-to-3D, and text-to-task models, each tailored to generate content within its
respective medium (Google Cloud Tech).
In conclusion, generative AI leverages the power of deep learning and neural
networks to learn and emulate patterns and relationships in data. This enables the AI to
create new content that closely resembles human-generated output/results. Furthermore,
this technology is revolutionizing various industries, offering exciting possibilities for the

difficulty in distinguishing it from real data. Another technique is text generation, where models
learn to predict the next work in a phrase based on the previous word. The AI leverages neural
networks and training data in order to produce new data that represents the data that was inputted

This aligns with the LATENT criteria's focus on mechanism explanation and synthesis.",4,"One of the most well-known architectures, like ChatGPT, employs a model, which can be likened to a city's road network.|makes choices influenced by various factors, including learned biases|the model generates subsequent words by selecting the most contextually fitting options to minimize 'cost' or error|its choices, much like familiar routes influence a driver's decisions in a city",FALSE,TRUE,2,1,BASELINE,
50,"1) Artificial Intelligence is a technology system that
creates content from recognizing patterns in data. It
also uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN).
This is where one generative and one discriminative
architecture compete to produce the best results. AI
has the capabilities of creating artwork, developing
vocal profiles, and can quickly find solutions to
problems. Many uses of AI range from creating
YouTube videos of presidents playing different
games to amazing artwork pieces. AI has been used to
help with research starting points as well as
blatantly writing papers for students. This works
because AI is always updating and learning. The
network that is created by programmers is trained to
recognize patterns in data. Once given the data to

pull from AI can create something new using those patterns and parameters. Artificial
Intelligence pulls for various resources like websites, articles, images, text, and audio files. The
programmers customize the parameters during training and allow the AI models to “make their
own conclusions.” Though that sounds impressive by itself, AI still needs humans to input the
initial data, tell it what relevant features are to be learned and have them evaluate the results
for
quality and relevance.",1,success,0.89,14,9,3,Artificial Intelligence|Generative Adversarial Networks|generative models|educational applications|integrated training algorithms|automated content creation|data-driven pattern recognition|semantic analysis|human oversight in AI|creative industry applications|system training inputs|evaluative performance metrics|open-ended applications|cross-industry capabilities,AI in education|creative industry applications|system training and learning|human-AI collaboration|cross-industry uses|educational support tools|texture generation systems|artistic texture creation mechanisms|texture generation capabilities,texture generation system|artistic texture creation mechanisms|texture generation capabilities,latent,0.85,"The answer demonstrates analysis of mechanism (GAN architecture) and synthesis of cross-domain applications (educational to creative industries).
