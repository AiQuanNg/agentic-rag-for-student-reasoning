3879,1,success,0.82,0,,7,2,4,4,AI works through machine learning algorithms that process big data. I saw on Stack Exchange that it uses neural networks with multiple layers. The AI trains on datasets and learns patterns over time. Theres something called deep learning which is more advanced. I found a screenshot from a Medium article mentioning backpropagation and gradient descent. The system optimizes its weights and biases through iterations. AI needs lots of computational power usually GPUs. Its based on mathematical models and statistical analysis but I dont really know the specifics.,artificial intelligence|neural networks|machine learning|deep learning|datasets|training|algorithm,technical|implementation,backpropagation|gradient descent|GPU optimization|statistical modeling,AI works through machine learning algorithms that process big data|neural networks with multiple layers|AI trains on datasets and learns patterns over time|deepenits effectiveness through iterations,
3880,1,success,0.85,0,,11,5,2,4,AI skills are super valuable in todays job market. I saw LinkedIn posts about how companies are hiring AI engineers with huge salaries. You need to know Python and machine learning frameworks to get these jobs. Someone shared a screenshot of AI job listings paying over $200k. The demand for AI talent is way higher than supply. If you want a good career you should definitely learn AI development. I found a Reddit thread where people discussed which AI certifications are worth getting. This is probably the best field to go into right now.,ai|machinelearning|frameworks|humancareer|salary|demand|supply|certifications|jobmarket|technology|future,"technical skills (Python, ML frameworks)|economic factors (salary, job demand)|career development|industry trends (LinkedIn, Reddit discussions)|market dynamics (demand vs supply)",generative AI|transformers,huge salaries|$200k|demand for AI talent is way higher than supply|best field to go into right now,
3881,1,success,0.85,0,,21,5,5,7,AI poses serious risks that people need to understand. I read forum posts about how AI could be dangerous if not controlled properly. Some experts worry about AI becoming too powerful. Theres screenshots from Twitter showing researchers warning about AI risks. The technology could be used for harmful purposes like deepfakes or misinformation. We need safety measures and alignment research. I saw a Hacker News discussion about AI existential risk. Companies developing AI should be more transparent about potential dangers. This is maybe the most important issue facing humanity right now according to some people online.,ai|artificialintelligence|dangers|risks|safetymeasures|alignmentresearch|existentialrisk|transparency|harmfulpurposes|misinformation|deepfakes|researchers|forumposts|expertopinions|stakes|importantissue|companies|developers|regulatoryoversight|ethicalimplications|societalimpact,Technical Risks|Ethical Considerations|Public Safety|Regulatory Frameworks|Research Prioritization,existentialrisk|alignmentresearch|harmfulpurposes|safetymeasures|ethicalimplications,AI poses serious risks that people need to understand.|Experts worry about AI becoming too powerful.|AI could be used for harmful purposes like deepfakes or misinformation.|Strong push for safety measures and alignment research.|Being marketed as the most important issue facing humanity.|AI companies should be more transparent about potential dangers.|Hacker News discussion about AI existential risk.,
