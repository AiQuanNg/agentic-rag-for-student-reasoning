1287,1,AI works through machine learning algorithms that process big data. I saw on Stack Exchange that it uses neural networks with multiple layers. The AI trains on datasets and learns patterns over time. Theres something called deep learning which is more advanced. I found a screenshot from a Medium article mentioning backpropagation and gradient descent. The system optimizes its weights and biases through iterations. AI needs lots of computational power usually GPUs. Its based on mathematical models and statistical analysis but I dont really know the specifics.,success,0.85,2,Definition of generative AI|How it gathers information,13,2,3,8,machine learning|algorithms|big data|neural networks|deep learning|backpropagation|gradient descent|datasets|training|patterns|computational power|mathematical models|statistical analysis,technical|implementation,weights and biases|GPUs|iterations,AI works through machine learning algorithms that process big data|it uses neural networks with multiple layers|The AI trains on datasets and learns patterns over time|Theres something called deep learning which is more advanced|mentioning backpropagation and gradient descent|The system optimizes its weights and biases through iterations|AI needs lots of computational power usually GPUs|Its based on mathematical models and statistical analysis,
1288,1,AI skills are super valuable in todays job market. I saw LinkedIn posts about how companies are hiring AI engineers with huge salaries. You need to know Python and machine learning frameworks to get these jobs. Someone shared a screenshot of AI job listings paying over $200k. The demand for AI talent is way higher than supply. If you want a good career you should definitely learn AI development. I found a Reddit thread where people discussed which AI certifications are worth getting. This is probably the best field to go into right now.,success,0.85,3,AI job market demand|AI skills and qualifications|Career opportunities in AI,3,2,8,6,ai|machine learning|learning,business|implementation,AI certifications|AI engineers|AI job listings|Python|LinkedIn posts|Reddit thread|salary|job market,AI skills are super valuable in todays job market|companies are hiring AI engineers with huge salaries|You need to know Python and machine learning frameworks to get these jobs|AI job listings paying over $200k|The demand for AI talent is way higher than supply|people discussed which AI certifications are worth getting,
1289,1,AI poses serious risks that people need to understand. I read forum posts about how AI could be dangerous if not controlled properly. Some experts worry about AI becoming too powerful. Theres screenshots from Twitter showing researchers warning about AI risks. The technology could be used for harmful purposes like deepfakes or misinformation. We need safety measures and alignment research. I saw a Hacker News discussion about AI existential risk. Companies developing AI should be more transparent about potential dangers. This is maybe the most important issue facing humanity right now according to some people online.,success,0.85,3,AI risks and safety concerns|Potential harmful applications of AI|Need for transparency and control,110,2,8,8,ai|artificial|artificialintelligence|intelligence|deep|deeplearning|machine|machinelearning|learn|learning|training|generate|generative|content|text|image|video|sound|music|voice|story|prose|poetry|song|picture|movie|motion|adversarial|gan|diffusion|stablediffusion|midjourney|dalle|jukebox|musiclm|bard|chatgpt|claude|gemini|gpt|llama|bert|transformer|attention|neural|network|neural|architecture|configuration|arrangement|organization|structure|framework|system|method|technique|algorithm|mechanism|interconnection|interrelation|relationship|association|correlation|dependence|pattern|context|prompt|input|output|response|feedback|reinforcement|rlhf|tune|refine|align|alignment|preference|evaluate|solve|problemsolving|problem|task|specific|original|new|create|creativity|mimic|replicate|understand|write|program|code|alphacode|copilot|snippet|document|paragraph|sentence|description|format|figure|huge|large|vast|big|data|datasets|training,ethical|strategic,existential risk|deepfakes|misinformation|safety measures|transparency|forum posts|Hacker News discussion|Twitter screenshots,AI poses serious risks that people need to understand|AI could be dangerous if not controlled properly|Some experts worry about AI becoming too powerful|The technology could be used for harmful purposes like deepfakes or misinformation|We need safety measures and alignment research|AI existential risk|Companies developing AI should be more transparent about potential dangers|This is maybe the most important issue facing humanity right now,
