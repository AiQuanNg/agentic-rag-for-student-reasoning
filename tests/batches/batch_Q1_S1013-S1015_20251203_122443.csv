3885,1,success,0.0,0,,0,0,0,0,"Generative AI is artificial intelligence designed to generate new content from learned patterns. From a Medium article screenshot I found, generative AI typically uses deep learning architectures like transformers or recurrent neural networks. These models contain many layers of artificial neurons that process information. The working process involves two main phases: training and generation. During training, the AI learns from billions of data points to understand patterns. A Facebook post from an AI researcher explained that during generation, when given a prompt, the model processes it through all its layers and produces output that follows learned patterns. The transformer architecture uses something called attention mechanisms to understand relationships between different parts of the input. This is why modern generative AI like GPT models can generate coherent, contextually relevant text.",,,,,
3886,1,success,0.85,1,Generative AI and How it gathers information,14,3,1,5,"Generative AI is a machine learning model trained to create new data that resembles its training data. I saw a discussion on Reddit where someone clearly explained that generative AI learns by being exposed to massive datasets—often hundreds of billions of examples. During training, the neural network adjusts its internal parameters to recognize and replicate patterns in this data. I found a screenshot from a HackerNews thread describing how during inference or generation, you provide input and the model produces output by repeatedly predicting the most likely next element. For text models like ChatGPT, this means predicting one word at a time. For image models like Stable Diffusion, it predicts pixels or image patches. The model essentially learns a probability distribution from training data and samples from it during generation. This is why generative AI can create completely original content while still maintaining patterns from what it learned.",machinelearning|datasets|neural|inference|output|generative|ai|training|parameters|probability|generate|original|chatgpt|stablediffusion,technical|business|ethical,probability distribution,Generative AI is a machine learning model trained to create new data|learns by being exposed to massive datasets|neural network adjusts its internal parameters|provides input and the model produces output|generative AI can create completely original content,

According to multiple posts on r/artificial, the core mechanism involves large neural networks, particularly transformer models, that process sequential information. These models are trained on billions of examples from the internet, books, and other sources. I found a LinkedIn article explaining that the model learns to predict what should come next in a sequence. When you provide a prompt, the generative AI uses this learned knowledge to generate output token-by-token or element-by-element. Examples like ChatGPT for text, DALL-E for images, and Jukebox for music all follow this general principle. A Twitter thread I referenced showed how these systems don't truly understand meaning but instead excel at pattern recognition and statistical prediction based on their training.",ai|generative|transformer|neural networks|content|training data|model|large|statistical prediction|machine learning|deep learning|pattern recognition|ChatGPT|DALL-E|Jukebox|multimodal systems,technical|strategic|ethical,,"AI systems generate new content (text, images, audio, video)|core mechanism involves large neural networks and transformer models|models trained on billions of examples from internet, books|generate output token-by-token through pattern recognition|systems 'excel at statistical prediction based on training'|ethical implications highlighted through lack of true understanding",
