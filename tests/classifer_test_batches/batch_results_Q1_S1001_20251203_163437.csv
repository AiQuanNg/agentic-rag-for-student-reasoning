1281,1,success,AI is becoming a huge issue in society today. I saw on Reddit that people are worried about AI taking jobs and theres a lot of debate about whether companies should be allowed to use AI without telling customers. Someone posted a screenshot showing how AI can be biased against certain groups. I think we need better laws to regulate AI before it gets out of control. The ethics of AI is super important and we cant ignore it just because the technology is cool. This is something everyone should care about not just tech people.,0.85,4,AI ethics and regulation|Societal impact of AI|AI bias concerns|Need for AI governance,8,3,4,ai|artificial|artificialintelligence|intelligence|human|bias|ethical|regulation,ethical|business|strategic,job displacement|transparency requirements|regulatory laws|societal concern,off_topic,0.95,"The question asks ""What is generative AI and how does it work?"" (fundamentals goal), but the student answer discusses AI ethics, regulation, job displacement, and societal concerns without addressing generative AI's definition or mechanisms. While the answer has matched keywords (AI, bias, ethical, regulation) and high extraction confidence (0.85), it completely fails to address the core question about generative AI fundamentals. The answer meets Level 0 rubric (mentions AI) but doesn't reach Level 50 (partial understanding of generative AI) or Level 100 (full understanding of how it works).",4,AI is becoming a huge issue in society today.|I saw on Reddit that people are worried about AI taking jobs|Someone posted a screenshot showing how AI can be biased against certain groups.|I think we need better laws to regulate AI before it gets out of control.,unknown,False,False,False,0,,,,,False,BASELINE,Answer is off-topic - discusses AI ethics/societal impact instead of generative AI fundamentals,
1282,1,success,I've been using AI tools a lot lately for my homework and they're really helpful! My roommate showed me this app that uses AI and its pretty amazing what it can do. I found a Twitter thread where someone was talking about how AI changed their workflow. Honestly I dont really understand the technical details of how any of it works but I know its based on algorithms or something. AI is definitely going to be huge in the future and everyone should learn to use it. I attached a screenshot from the Twitter discussion about AI productivity hacks.,0.65,4,AI tools for homework|AI productivity applications|AI impact on workflow|Future importance of AI,6,3,4,ai|algorithm|generate|tool|workflow|productivity,technical|business|strategic,homework|Twitter thread|productivity hacks|screenshot,off_topic,0.85,"The question asks ""What is generative AI and how does it work?"" requiring definitions and mechanism explanations. The student answer discusses personal AI tool usage, Twitter threads, and productivity hacks but fails to define generative AI or explain its mechanisms. While it contains some AI-related keywords, it lacks substantive content addressing the core question. The answer meets Level 0 rubric (no understanding) as it doesn't provide any meaningful explanation of generative AI fundamentals.",3,I've been using AI tools a lot lately for my homework and they're really helpful!|I dont really understand the technical details of how any of it works but I know its based on algorithms or something.|AI is definitely going to be huge in the future and everyone should learn to use it.,unknown,False,False,False,0,,,,,False,BASELINE,Answer is off-topic with no substantive content about generative AI fundamentals,
1283,1,success,AI is used in computer vision systems to recognize objects in images. I found some posts on Stack Overflow about image classification where the AI looks at pixels and identifies patterns. Like it can tell if theres a cat or dog in a photo. The system uses convolutional layers to process the visual data. Heres a screenshot from a Reddit post showing someone's AI that can detect faces. Its pretty cool how accurate these systems have gotten. Computer vision is probably the most important application of AI right now.,0.85,4,Computer vision applications|Image classification|Pattern recognition in images|Convolutional neural networks,10,2,4,computer vision|image|pattern|neural|system|ai|artificial intelligence|learning|data|training,technical|implementation,convolutional layers|face detection|Stack Overflow|Reddit,off_topic,0.9,"The question asks ""What is generative AI and how does it work?"" which is a fundamentals question about generative AI mechanisms. The student answer discusses computer vision applications, image classification, and convolutional neural networks, but completely fails to address generative AI. While the answer shows technical knowledge about AI applications in computer vision, it does not answer the actual question about generative AI fundamentals. The extractor found many AI-related keywords but no generative AI concepts, and the novel terms are all about computer vision rather than generative AI.",4,AI is used in computer vision systems to recognize objects in images.|Like it can tell if theres a cat or dog in a photo.|The system uses convolutional layers to process the visual data.|Computer vision is probably the most important application of AI right now.,unknown,False,False,False,0,,,,,False,BASELINE,Answer is off-topic - discusses computer vision instead of generative AI,
