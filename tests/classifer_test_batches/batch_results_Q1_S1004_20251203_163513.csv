1284,1,success,AI has been around since the 1950s when researchers first started working on machine intelligence. I read on Quora that Alan Turing created the Turing Test to see if machines could think. Modern AI uses neural networks which are inspired by the human brain. Theres different types of AI like narrow AI and general AI. I saw a YouTube comment thread discussing how AI has evolved over the decades. The field has made huge progress but we still dont have true artificial general intelligence yet. AI research continues to advance every year.,0.85,4,AI history and evolution|Types of AI|Neural networks|Artificial general intelligence,8,2,3,artificial|artificialintelligence|neural|network|machine|intelligence|human|research,technical|historical,Turing Test|narrow AI|general AI,off_topic,0.9,"The question asks ""What is generative AI and how does it work?"" but the student answer discusses general AI history, Turing Test, neural networks, and AI types without addressing generative AI specifically. While the answer shows some AI knowledge with matched keywords (artificial, neural, network, machine, intelligence) and novel terms (Turing Test, narrow AI, general AI), it completely misses the core question about generative AI. The extraction confidence is high (0.85) but the content is fundamentally misaligned with the question goal of learning generative AI fundamentals.",5,AI has been around since the 1950s when researchers first started working on machine intelligence.|I read on Quora that Alan Turing created the Turing Test to see if machines could think.|Modern AI uses neural networks which are inspired by the human brain.|Theres different types of AI like narrow AI and general AI.|The field has made huge progress but we still dont have true artificial general intelligence yet.,unknown,False,False,False,0,,,,,False,BASELINE,Answer is fundamentally off-topic - discusses general AI instead of generative AI,
1285,1,success,"There are so many AI tools available now. ChatGPT is probably the most famous one and everyone uses it. I saw screenshots on Twitter of people using DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion. Theres also AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot. Someone on Reddit made a huge list of AI tools and it had like 100 different options. Businesses are investing billions in AI technology.

The student answer only lists AI tools (ChatGPT, DALL-E, etc.), mentions industry growth and investments, but completely fails to define generative AI or explain how it works. While the extractor found many keywords (confidence 0.85), these are only tool names, not explanations of generative AI fundamentals.

1286,1,success,The main difference between AI and humans is that AI doesnt have real consciousness or emotions. I found a discussion on Reddit where people debated whether AI can actually think. AI just follows programmed instructions while humans have creativity and intuition. Some people posted screenshots showing AI making mistakes that humans wouldnt make. AI cant understand context the same way we do. Its good at specific tasks but not general reasoning. I think AI will never fully replace human intelligence because theres something unique about how our brains work that machines cant replicate.,0.85,5,AI vs human intelligence|Consciousness and emotions|AI limitations in reasoning|Human creativity and intuition|Context understanding,7,2,3,ai|human|creativity|context|intelligence|understand|task,technical|ethical,consciousness|intuition|general reasoning,off_topic,0.9,"The question asks ""What is generative AI and how does it work?""

While the answer has matched keywords (ai, human, creativity, etc.) and novel terms (consciousness, intuition, general reasoning), it fundamentally fails to address the core question about generative AI's definition and mechanisms. The answer meets Level 0 rubric (no understanding of generative AI) as it doesn't define or explain generative AI at all, instead focusing on general AI limitations compared to humans.",4,The main difference between AI and humans is that AI doesnt have real consciousness or emotions.|AI just follows programmed instructions while humans have creativity and intuition.|AI cant understand context the same way we do.
