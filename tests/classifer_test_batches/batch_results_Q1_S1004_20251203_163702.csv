1284,1,success,AI has been around since the 1950s when researchers first started working on machine intelligence. I read on Quora that Alan Turing created the Turing Test to see if machines could think. Modern AI uses neural networks which are inspired by the human brain. Theres different types of AI like narrow AI and general AI. I saw a YouTube comment thread discussing how AI has evolved over the decades. The field has made huge progress but we still dont have true artificial general intelligence yet. AI research continues to advance every year.,0.85,4,AI history and evolution|Types of AI|Neural networks|Artificial general intelligence,8,2,3,artificial|artificialintelligence|neural|network|machine|intelligence|human|research,technical|historical,Turing Test|narrow AI|general AI,off_topic,0.9,"The question asks ""What is generative AI and how does it work?"" but the student answer discusses general AI history, Turing Test, neural networks, and AI types without addressing generative AI specifically. While the answer shows some AI knowledge with matched keywords (artificial, neural, network, machine, intelligence) and novel terms (Turing Test, narrow AI, general AI), it completely misses the core question about generative AI. The Level 0 rubric requires ""No understanding"" - this answer demonstrates understanding of AI concepts but not the specific generative AI topic, making it off-topic despite having technical content.",5,AI has been around since the 1950s when researchers first started working on machine intelligence.|I read on Quora that Alan Turing created the Turing Test to see if machines could think.|Modern AI uses neural networks which are inspired by the human brain.|Theres different types of AI like narrow AI and general AI.|The field has made huge progress but we still dont have true artificial general intelligence yet.,unknown,False,False,False,0,,,,,False,BASELINE,Answer is off-topic - discusses general AI instead of generative AI,
1285,1,success,"There are so many AI tools available now. ChatGPT is probably the most famous one and everyone uses it. I saw screenshots on Twitter of people using DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion. Theres also AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot.

1286,1,success,The main difference between AI and humans is that AI doesnt have real consciousness or emotions. I found a discussion on Reddit where people debated whether AI can actually think. AI just follows programmed instructions while humans have creativity and intuition. Some people posted screenshots showing AI making mistakes that humans wouldnt make. AI cant understand context the same way we do. Its good at specific tasks but not general reasoning. I think AI will never fully replace human intelligence because theres something unique about how our brains work that machines cant replicate.,0.85,5,AI vs human intelligence|Consciousness and emotions|AI limitations in reasoning|Human creativity and intuition|Context understanding,7,2,3,ai|human|creativity|context|intelligence|understand|task,technical|ethical,consciousness|intuition|general reasoning,off_topic,0.95,"The question asks ""What is generative AI and how does it work?"" but the student answer discusses AI vs human intelligence differences, consciousness, and limitations without addressing generative AI specifically.
