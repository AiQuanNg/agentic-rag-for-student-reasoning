1287,1,success,AI works through machine learning algorithms that process big data. I saw on Stack Exchange that it uses neural networks with multiple layers. The AI trains on datasets and learns patterns over time. Theres something called deep learning which is more advanced. I found a screenshot from a Medium article mentioning backpropagation and gradient descent. The system optimizes its weights and biases through iterations. AI needs lots of computational power usually GPUs. Its based on mathematical models and statistical analysis but I dont really know the specifics.,0.85,2,Definition of generative AI|How it gathers information,13,2,3,machine learning|algorithms|big data|neural networks|deep learning|backpropagation|gradient descent|datasets|training|patterns|computational power|mathematical models|statistical analysis,technical|implementation,weights and biases|GPUs|iterations,standard,0.85,"This is Question #1 about generative AI fundamentals, requiring definitions and mechanisms. The student demonstrates strong recall of technical terminology (13 matched keywords) and accurately describes the training process, neural networks, and computational requirements. However, while they mention key concepts like backpropagation, gradient descent, weights/biases, and GPUs, they don't explain the mechanisms or connections between these elements. The answer shows comprehension but lacks deeper analysis of how generative AI specifically works beyond general machine learning processes.",7,AI works through machine learning algorithms that process big data|I saw on Stack Exchange that it uses neural networks with multiple layers|The AI trains on datasets and learns patterns over time|Theres something called deep learning which is more advanced|I found a screenshot from a Medium article mentioning backpropagation and gradient descent|The system optimizes its weights and biases through iterations|AI needs lots of computational power usually GPUs,unknown,False,False,False,0,,,,,False,BASELINE,No latent signals detected - answer shows strong recall but lacks deeper reasoning mechanisms,
1288,1,success,AI skills are super valuable in todays job market. I saw LinkedIn posts about how companies are hiring AI engineers with huge salaries. You need to know Python and machine learning frameworks to get these jobs. Someone shared a screenshot of AI job listings paying over $200k. The demand for AI talent is way higher than supply. If you want a good career you should definitely learn AI development. I found a Reddit thread where people discussed which AI certifications are worth getting. This is probably the best field to go into right now.,0.85,3,AI job market demand|AI skills and qualifications|Career opportunities in AI,3,2,8,ai|machine learning|learning,business|implementation,AI certifications|AI engineers|AI job listings|Python|LinkedIn posts|Reddit thread|salary|job market,off_topic,0.95,"The question asks ""What is generative AI and how does it work?"" (fundamentals goal), but the student answer discusses AI job market trends, salaries, and career advice without addressing generative AI's definition or mechanisms. While the Extractor found high confidence (0.85) and matched keywords (ai, machine learning, learning), these are generic AI terms not specific to generative AI. The answer fails to meet Level 0 rubric criteria for understanding generative AI fundamentals, as it provides no relevant content about what generative AI is or how it works.",4,AI skills are super valuable in todays job market.|I saw LinkedIn posts about how companies are hiring AI engineers with huge salaries.|Someone shared a screenshot of AI job listings paying over $200k.|If you want a good career you should definitely learn AI development.,unknown,False,False,False,0,,,,,False,BASELINE,Answer is completely off-topic regarding generative AI fundamentals; novel terms relate to AI job market not generative AI mechanisms,
1289,1,success,AI poses serious risks that people need to understand. I read forum posts about how AI could be dangerous if not controlled properly. Some experts worry about AI becoming too powerful. Theres screenshots from Twitter showing researchers warning about AI risks. The technology could be used for harmful purposes like deepfakes or misinformation. We need safety measures and alignment research. I saw a Hacker News discussion about AI existential risk. Companies developing AI should be more transparent about potential dangers.

While the answer shows engagement with AI topics and has high extraction confidence (0.85), it completely misses the question's fundamental goal of explaining generative AI basics.
