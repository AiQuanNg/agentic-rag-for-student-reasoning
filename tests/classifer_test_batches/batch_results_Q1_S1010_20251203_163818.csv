1290,1,success,AI is everywhere in movies and TV shows now. I saw Reddit threads analyzing how AI is portrayed in science fiction vs reality. Shows like Black Mirror and Westworld explore AI themes. Theres screenshots from Twitter where people discuss realistic vs unrealistic AI in media. Most movies exaggerate what AI can actually do. The Terminator gave people a scary view of AI but real AI isnt like that. I found posts comparing different AI characters from various films. Pop culture shapes how society thinks about AI even though its not always accurate. Its interesting to see how our perception of AI has changed through entertainment over time.,0.85,3,AI in media and entertainment|Public perception of AI through pop culture|Comparison of fictional vs real AI,6,2,5,ai|artificial|artificialintelligence|movie|human|intelligence,ethical|strategic,pop culture|science fiction|media portrayal|public perception|entertainment,off_topic,0.95,"The question asks ""What is generative AI and how does it work?"" (fundamentals goal), but the student answer discusses AI in media, pop culture, and entertainment without addressing generative AI's definition or mechanisms. While the Extractor found matched keywords (AI, artificial intelligence) and high extraction confidence (0.85), the answer completely misses the question's core focus on generative AI fundamentals. The answer shows awareness of AI in society but lacks any relevant understanding of generative AI's definition, workings, or technical aspects.",3,AI is everywhere in movies and TV shows now.|Shows like Black Mirror and Westworld explore AI themes.|Pop culture shapes how society thinks about AI even though its not always accurate.,unknown,False,False,False,0,,,,,False,BASELINE,Answer is completely off-topic regarding generative AI fundamentals,
1291,1,success,"Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content based on patterns it has learned. According to a post I found on Reddit's r/MachineLearning, generative AI uses neural networks to analyze training data and then generates new text, images, or other media that are similar to what it learned. The system works by learning statistical patterns from large datasets. When you input a prompt, the AI uses these learned patterns to predict and generate output one piece at a time. Popular examples include ChatGPT, which generates text, and DALL-E, which generates images. I saw a LinkedIn discussion where someone explained that generative AI doesn't truly understand concepts like humans do—it predicts what should come next based on probability distributions from training data. This fundamental approach makes it different from other AI systems.",0.92,2,Definition of generative AI|How generative AI gathers information,20,2,3,generative|artificial intelligence|create|neural networks|training data|datasets|patterns|learn|text|images|media|prompt|predict|generate|output|chatgpt|dalle|probability|statistical|understanding,technical|implementation,probability distributions|statistical patterns|one piece at a time,latent,0.88,"This is Question #1 about generative AI fundamentals, where the goal is to learn basics. The student answer demonstrates full understanding (Level 100) by explaining both what generative AI is AND how it works through mechanism explanations. The answer shows latent reasoning through: (1) mechanism explanation (""works by learning statistical patterns... uses these learned patterns to predict and generate output one piece at a time""), (2) critical engagement distinguishing AI from human understanding, and (3) novel terminology like ""probability distributions"" and ""statistical patterns"" used in substantive explanations.",4,"generative AI uses neural networks to analyze training data and then generates new text, images, or other media that are similar to what it learned|The system works by learning statistical patterns from large datasets|When you input a prompt, the AI uses these learned patterns to predict and generate output one piece at a time|generative AI doesn't truly understand concepts like humans do—it predicts what should come next based on probability distributions from training data",unknown,False,False,False,0,,,,,False,BASELINE,Clear latent reasoning with high confidence; novel terms are well-integrated into mechanism explanations,
1292,1,success,"Generative AI works by being trained on massive amounts of data, then using that learning to generate completely new content. I found a Stack Overflow thread explaining that generative AI models, especially transformer-based ones, process input sequentially and predict the next token or element. The training process involves showing the model millions of examples so it learns patterns and relationships. According to a Quora answer, the key mechanism is that after training, when you give the AI a prompt, it generates output by calculating probabilities for what should come next. Each generated piece becomes the input for the next prediction. I found screenshots on Twitter showing how ChatGPT generates responses word-by-word using this process.
