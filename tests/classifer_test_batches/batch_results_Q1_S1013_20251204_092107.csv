1293,1,success,"Generative AI is artificial intelligence designed to generate new content from learned patterns. From a Medium article screenshot I found, generative AI typically uses deep learning architectures like transformers or recurrent neural networks. These models contain many layers of artificial neurons that process information. The working process involves two main phases: training and generation. During training, the AI learns from billions of data points to understand patterns. A Facebook post from an AI researcher explained that during generation, when given a prompt, the model processes it through all its layers and produces output that follows learned patterns. The transformer architecture uses something called attention mechanisms to understand relationships between different parts of the input.

1294,1,success,"Generative AI is a machine learning model trained to create new data that resembles its training data. I saw a discussion on Reddit where someone clearly explained that generative AI learns by being exposed to massive datasets—often hundreds of billions of examples. During training, the neural network adjusts its internal parameters to recognize and replicate patterns in this data. I found a screenshot from a HackerNews thread describing how during inference or generation, you provide input and the model produces output by repeatedly predicting the most likely next element. For text models like ChatGPT, this means predicting one word at a time. For image models like Stable Diffusion, it predicts pixels or image patches. The model essentially learns a probability distribution from training data and samples from it during generation.

1295,1,success,"Generative AI refers to AI systems that can generate new content such as text, images, audio, or video based on patterns from training data. According to multiple posts on r/artificial, the core mechanism involves large neural networks, particularly transformer models, that process sequential information. These models are trained on billions of examples from the internet, books, and other sources. I found a LinkedIn article explaining that the model learns to predict what should come next in a sequence. When you provide a prompt, the generative AI uses this learned knowledge to generate output token-by-token or element-by-element. Examples like ChatGPT for text, DALL-E for images, and Jukebox for music all follow this general principle.
