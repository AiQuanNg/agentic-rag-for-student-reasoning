1296,1,success,"Generative AI is an AI system capable of producing original content in response to user input. From a YouTube comment discussion about AI, I learned that generative models work by learning the underlying distribution of training data. The architecture typically involves transformers or other deep neural networks with billions of parameters. During the training phase, the model processes examples and adjusts weights to minimize prediction errors. During the generation phase, given a prompt, the model applies its learned parameters to generate relevant output. A Stack Overflow post explained that text generative AI like GPT models generate responses by computing probability scores for each possible next word, then sampling the most likely one. This process repeats iteratively to build complete responses. The model essentially learns statistical relationships between concepts in its training data and uses these to create coherent new content.",0.95,2,Definition of generative AI|How generative AI gathers information,30,2,4,generative|ai|system|content|input|models|training|data|architecture|transformers|neural|networks|parameters|training|phase|weights|prediction|prompt|output|text|gpt|generate|responses|probability|word|sampling|statistical|relationships|concepts|coherent,technical|implementation,underlying distribution|prediction errors|probability scores|iteratively,latent,0.95,"Answer demonstrates full understanding (Level 100 rubric) by providing both accurate definition and detailed technical explanation of how generative AI works.

1297,1,success,"Generative AI is artificial intelligence that can create new content in various formats by learning from existing data. I found detailed explanations on Reddit's r/AskScience describing how generative models are built using neural networks with many interconnected layers. The system learns by processing massive training datasets and identifying patterns in how data is structured. According to a Quora thread I referenced, the generation process works like this: you input a prompt, the model processes it through its learned neural network, and produces output by predicting likely continuations. Examples include ChatGPT which generates text word-by-word, DALL-E which generates images, and Midjourney which creates high-quality visual art.

1298,1,success,"Generative AI is a category of artificial intelligence designed to generate new, original content. From educational posts I found on social media, generative AI uses machine learning, specifically deep learning models like transformers and neural networks. The fundamental idea is that these models are trained on large datasets containing billions of examples of text, images, or other media. During training, the model learns the statistical patterns and relationships within this data. I saw a detailed explanation on Stack Exchange about how generative AI works: it analyzes a user prompt, processes it through trained neural layers, and produces output by repeatedly selecting the most probable next element. For text generation like ChatGPT, this means selecting the most likely next word. For image generation like Stable Diffusion, this involves generating image data that follows learned visual patterns.
